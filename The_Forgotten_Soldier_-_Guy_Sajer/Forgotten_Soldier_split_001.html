<p class="calibre3">If for some the fall of Stalingrad was a staggering blow, for others it provoked a spirit of revenge which rekindled faltering spirits. In our group, given the wide range of ages, opinion was divided. The older men were, generally speaking, defeatist, while the younger ones were determined to liberate their comrades. We were walking back to our dormitory when a fight broke out for which I was mainly responsible.</p><p class="calibre3">The fellow with the broken knee, my companion in that damned Renault, had just fallen into step with me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, you must be pleased," he said. "It sounds as if we'll be going back tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre3">I could see a certain irony on his face, and felt myself turning red with anger.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's enough from you," I shouted. "I hope you're satisfied. We're going back, and it's at least partly your fault if my uncle is dead in Stalingrad."</p><p class="calibre3">He turned pale.</p><p class="calibre3">"Who told you he's dead?"</p><p class="calibre3">"If he's not dead that's even worse,"</p><p class="calibre3">I went on shouting. "You're nothing but a coward. It's you who told me we ought to leave them to their fate."</p><p class="calibre3">My companion was astonished, and looked around for reactions. Then he grabbed my collar. "Shut up!" he ordered, lifting his fist.</p><p class="calibre3">I kicked him in the shin. He was going to hit me when Hals grabbed his arm.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's enough," he said calmly. "Stop it, or you'll get yourselves thrown in jail."</p><p class="calibre3">"So. You're another young fellow who wants what's coming to him?"</p><p class="calibre3">My antagonist was now carried away with rage. "I'm going to give it to all of you, you . . ."</p><p class="calibre3">"Drop it," Hals insisted. "Shit."</p><p class="calibre3">He didn't say anything more. A blow from Hal's fist caught him on the chin. He spun round and fell onto his backside in the snow. By now Lensen had come up too.</p><p class="calibre3">"You bunch of kid shits," shouted my driver. He tried to get up to return to the attack.</p><p class="calibre3">Lensen, short and thick-set, kicked him in the face with his metaled boot before he'd regained his balance. He fell onto his knees with a cry of pain, lifting his hands to his bloody face.</p><p class="calibre3">"Savage," somebody shouted.</p><p class="calibre3">We didn't persist further, and rejoined the group, swearing under our breath. The others looked at us blackly, and two of them helped my driver to his feet. He was still groaning.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll have to look out for that one," Hals warned.</p><p class="calibre3">"He might very well shoot one of us in the back the next time we're attacked."</p><p class="calibre3">Reveille the next day was later than usual. We went out for company roll call and were greeted by a whirlwind of snow. With our heads muffled in our upturned collars to escape the stinging ice fragments in the wind, we heard some good news. Feldwebel Laus, whom we hadn't seen in an eternity, was standing in front of us holding a piece of paper with both hands. He too was having trouble with the wind.</p><p class="calibre3">"Soldiers!" he read, in the lull between two gusts.</p><p class="calibre3">"The High Command, aware of your condition, grants you a leave of twenty-four hours. Nevertheless, given the present situation, a counter order could come at any time. You will, therefore, present yourselves at your billets every two hours. Needless to say, this will not give you time to call on lady friends or visit your families," he added, laughing. "But at least you'll be able to write to them."</p><p class="calibre3">Laus sent two men to fetch the mail, which was then distributed. There were four letters and a package for me. We would have liked to look at Kharkov, but the appalling weather kept us indoors. We spent a restful day, preparing for the return journey. We were therefore astonished to be told next day that we would re-supply with food and weapons a unit stationed in the combat zone. We were even given more or less precisely the location of our new destination. We were to proceed to a sector somewhere to the south of Voronezh. We received this news without enthusiasm.</p><p class="calibre3">"Bah!" said Hals. "Whether we tramp through the snow to Kiev or to Voronezh, it's all the same thing."</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes," said Olensheim somewhat cautiously. "But Voronezh is at the front."</p><p class="calibre3">"I know," said Hals. "But we'll have to see it sometime."</p><p class="calibre3">As for me, I didn't know what to think. What really happened on a battlefield? I felt torn by curiosity and fear.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><a id="filepos167724" class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE FRONT</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold">South of Voronezh - The Don</span></p><p class="calibre3">Winter seemed endless. It snowed every day, almost without a break.</p><p class="calibre3">At the end of February or beginning of March-1 no longer remember which-we were taken by rail to a town used as a major supply center, some fifty miles from Kharkov. Food, blankets, medicines, and other supplies were stored in big sheds, and every cellar and hole in the ground was jammed with munitions. There were also repair shops some indoors, others in the open air. Soldiers perching on tanks blew on their fingers when they grew too numb to hold a wrench. A system of trenches and strongpoints had been organized on the outskirts of the town. This part of the country suffered from frequent partisan attacks, often by large groups of men. Whenever this happened, every mechanic and warehouseman abandoned his tools and inventories for a machine gun, to protect the supplies and himself.</p><p class="calibre3">"The only advantage we have here," one of the soldiers said to me, "is that we're very well fed. There's an awful lot of work. We have to organize our own defense-we take turns standing guard-and things can get pretty tough with the partisans. They've given us some hard times, even with all of us fighting, and they've already destroyed a lot. Several times the C.O. has asked for an infantry unit to help him out-but it's only happened once. An S.S. company came, but three days later they were sent on to the Sixth Army. We've already had forty killed, which is a lot for one company."</p><p class="calibre3">That afternoon, we organized an odd-looking convoy using four wheeled Russian carts to which runners could be attached, transforming them into sleighs. There were also some real sleighs-a few eidekas and even two or three troikas covered with decorations-all requisitioned from Russian civilians. As we started off, I remember wondering where we were taking this convoy, which looked so like Christmas, but whose load of shells and grenades was of such a different character.</p><p class="calibre3">We set off towards the northwest, and a sector somewhere near Voronezh. We had been given special rations for the cold, new first-aid kits, and a two-day supply of precooked dinners. We took a track more or less blocked with snow-which crossed the line of defenses that cut off the steppe. A bulky, hooded soldier, who was the only sentry in sight, waved to us as we slowly went by him. His round shape looked enormously vulnerable as he stood there, puffing on a huge covered pipe, with his feet planted in the snow.</p><p class="calibre3">After an hour or so on the trail, which grew increasingly snowy, we fastened the runners to the wheels. Our leather boots, although they were remarkably waterproof, were not the ideal foot gear For tramping through nearly two feet of snow. We tired quickly, and hung on to the horses' harnesses or the edges of the sleighs with the desperation of cripples clinging to their canes. I myself twisted my fingers into the long hair of one of those shaggy ponies whose pelts are thick and tufted, like sheep's wool. However, the horses' pace was too quick, and forced us into an exhausting rhythm which made us pour with sweat despite the cold. From time to time one of the leaders of a column would stop and watch the long convoy going by, catching his breath under the pretext of checking the line of march. When they rejoined the column, it was always at the end of the line: I never saw anyone run back to the front.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals, who had become a real friend, was holding on to the other side of my horse. Although he was much bigger and stronger than I, he also looked as though he were nearly through. His face was almost hidden between his upturned collar and his cap, which had been pulled down as far as it could go. His red nose, like everyone else's, was producing a plume of white vapor.</p><p class="calibre3">We hardly spoke. I had learned to be as silent as Germans usually are. But, even without words, I knew that Hals was a friend who felt as warmly toward me as I did toward him. We gave each other occasional smiles of encouragement, as if to say: "Hang on! We'll make it!"</p><p class="calibre3">We halted at dusk. Feeling that I had been pushed beyond the limits of my strength, I collapsed onto a cart shaft. My legs ached with stiffness, and I could feel exhaustion pulling down my face.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals let himself fall onto the snow.</p><p class="calibre3">"Aie, my poor feet."</p><p class="calibre3">All along the convoy, men were sitting or lying on the snow.</p><p class="calibre3">"We're not spending the night here, are we?" asked a young soldier who was sitting next to me.</p><p class="calibre3">We looked at each other uneasily.</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't give a damn what anyone else does," said Hals, opening his mess tin. "I'm not taking another step."</p><p class="calibre3">"You say that because you're still sweating. Wait until you're a little colder. Then you'll have to move if you don't want to freeze." "Shit," said Hals without looking up.</p><p class="calibre3">"This food stinks."</p><p class="calibre3">I opened my mess tin too. The cooked dinners they had given us early in the afternoon had long since cooled, and then frozen in the metal containers. It looked like tripe.</p><p class="calibre3">All around us, other soldiers were making the same discovery.</p><p class="calibre3">"God damn it!" said Hals. "But there's no point in just throwing it out."</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think?" someone asked a feld, who was looking at the stuff in his own tin.</p><p class="calibre3">"Those bastards must have given us rotten meat."</p><p class="calibre3">"Or a week of leftovers. It's unbelievable. There's enough food in that town for a whole division."</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not edible.... It stinks!" "We'll have to get out some cans."</p><p class="calibre3">"No you won't," the feldwebel flared out at us. "We still have a long way to go, and none too much food as it is. Throw away the meat if you don't like it, and eat the cereal."</p><p class="calibre3">Hals, who was never too particular, crunched something vaguely like a lamb cutlet between his teeth. Two seconds later, he spat it out on the snow.</p><p class="calibre3">"Pah! It's rotten. The shits must have cooked a Bolshevik."</p><p class="calibre3">In spite of our dismal situation, we couldn't help laughing. Faced with the ruins of the meal he had been anticipating with such eagerness, Hals was on the brink of one of his rare fits of rage. Given his giant size, these were always impressive. With a stream of oaths, he gave his mess tin a magisterial kick, which sent it flying across the snow. There was a silence, and then a few laughs.</p><p class="calibre3">"You've made things a lot better for yourself," said the young soldier standing beside me.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals spun round, but said nothing. Then he slowly went off to pick up his tin. I began to wolf down the mess which had been flavored by the rotten meat. Hals, who looked crushed, collected his battered tin, whose contents had been scattered across the snow. A few minutes later, cursing a cruel fate, we were both digging into my ration.</p><p class="calibre3">The noncoms appointed guards, and we were faced with the problem of where to sleep. Already clenched with cold, we wondered where and how to spread out our ground sheets. Some men dug themselves hollows in the snow, others constructed rough huts, using the sacks of dried grass which hung from each side of the horses' collars. Others tried to insure a supply of warmth by making the horses lie down. We had already spent several nights out of doors, but always under more or less sheltered conditions. The fact of sleeping absolutely in the open in such appalling cold terrified us. Here and there, clusters of men discussed what we might do. Some thought we should keep on walking until we came to a village, or at least to some sort of building, on the grounds that it was better to die of exhaustion than of cold. According to this faction, if we stayed where we were, at least half of us would be dead by morning.</p><p class="calibre3">"We won't be coming to any village for at least three days," the noncoms told us.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll have to make out the best we can."</p><p class="calibre3">"If only we could light a fire!" one man exclaimed. His teeth were chattering, and his voice was almost a whimper. Appalled by the prospect, we prepared ourselves for the night as best we could. Hals and I reorganized the load on a sleigh so that there was a space between the cases of explosives big enough to hold us both. Despite the obvious danger of such a resting place, we preferred disintegration in a hot flash to death by freezing.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals had the spirit to crack a few obscene jokes, and they made me laugh in spite of my misery. We managed to doze intermittently, huddled together, haunted by the fear of freezing in our sleep.</p><p class="calibre3">We spent a fortnight in these bitter conditions, and it proved fatal for many of our group. On the third day we had two cases of pneumonia. On subsequent days we had frozen limbs and Hergezogener Brand, a kind of gangrene from cold, which first attacks the exposed portion of the face, and then other parts of the body, even if they are covered. Those affected by this condition had to apply a thick yellow pomade, which made them look both comic and pitiable. Two soldiers, driven mad by despair, left the convoy one night, and lost themselves in the featureless immensity of snow. Another very young soldier called for his mother, and cried for hours. We tried alternately comforting and cursing him for disturbing our rest. Toward morning, after he had been quiet for a while, a shot jolted us all awake. We found him a short way off, where he had tried to put an end to his nightmare. But he had bungled his effort and didn't die until the afternoon.</p><p class="calibre3">My feet, tortured by so much walking and by the cold, caused me agonizing pain at first, but soon became so numb that I felt almost nothing. Later, when a doctor checked us, I saw that three of my toes had turned an ashen gray. Their nails remained stuck to the double pair of pestilential socks which I took off for the examination. A painful injection saved by toes from amputation. It still seems astonishing to me that any of us should have survived such an ordeal; especially I, who have never been particularly strong.</p><p class="calibre3">Now, "at last," I was going to experience war at the front-and ordeals far worse than anything I had yet known.</p><p class="calibre3">We used the huts and bunkers of a temporary Luftwaffe airfield for a rest that was indispensable. Most of the field had been abandoned by the Luftwaffe, which had been forced to withdraw farther to the west. Some fighter planes were still there, in various states of disrepair and covered with ice, but a rump ground staff had moved out most of the equipment on big sleighs pulled by tractors.</p><p class="calibre3">We were allowed several days to restore ourselves in these more or less comfortable circumstances. However, the moment we began to look better, the authorities plunged us back into the thick of things. For the fighting troops of that sector, our company represented a considerable and unexpected supply of manpower. We were divided into fatigue parties and assigned various jobs. Three-quarters of our men were put to work preparing positions for 77s and even for light machine guns. This meant shoveling masses of snow, and then attacking the earth, which was as hard as rock, with picks and explosives.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals, Lensen, and I had managed to stay together. We were in a group that was ordered to supply an infantry section about ten miles away with food and ammunition. We were given two sleighs, each with a troika of shaggy steppe ponies. The distance was not great, our equipment was better than we'd had on our last tragic expedition, and thinking that we could easily manage the round trip in a day, we accepted the job as an easy one.</p><p class="calibre3">There were eight of us altogether, counting the sergeant. I was on the second sleigh, which was carrying grenades and magazines for spandaus. *  (* Machine gun from the Spandau works).</p><p class="calibre3">Sitting on the back of the sleigh, I had plenty of time to observe the dreary, empty landscape. At rare intervals, small stands of spindly trees thrust up from the immaculate white ground. They seemed to be engaged in an unequal struggle with the overpowering whiteness; it seemed to be gaining on them, slowly but surely. There was nothing else to be seen in this countryside, which must surely be inhabited by wolves-nothing except for the opaque, grayish-yellow sky. We seemed to have reached the far end of the world.</p><p class="calibre3">After a short time, we were following a depression in the snow which we took as an indication of a path. As we came to the edge of a thick forest, a soldier jumped up from behind a pile of wood, and stood in front of our first sleigh, which came to a dead stop. After a few words with our sergeant, he stepped aside, and we entered the forest, where we saw a spandau in action, manned by two soldiers, and further on an antlike swarm of soldiers and innumerable gray tents. There were a great many big guns, light tanks of the Alpenberg type, Paks,*( Anti-tank guns) and mortars set up on sleighs. A slaughtered horse had been pulled up into a tree, and was gradually being transformed into steaks by soldiers whose coats were spattered with blood. We were besieged by soldiers who asked us for mail, and cursed us when we said we didn't have any.</p><p class="calibre3">An officer checked our orders. The company we were to resupply was farther to the east. He sent an orderly to guide us. We continued through the woods, which concealed some three or four thousand men, and then crossed a series of small, partly cleared hills; I can still see them with absolute clarity. The white snow was crossed by three telephone lines which had been more or less covered over.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here we are," said the orderly, who was on horseback. "Beyond this crest you will be under enemy fire, so go as quickly as you can. Follow the telephone line. The company you're looking for is about a mile and a quarter from here."</p><p class="calibre3">He saluted in the prescribed fashion and went off at a trot. We looked at each other.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, here I go again," said our sergeant, who undoubtedly was a long-time Rollbahn veteran.</p><p class="calibre3">He waved us forward, then stopped us.</p><p class="calibre3">"We're going to try and get there really fast. Don't be afraid to beat the horses. If the Russians see us, they'll open fire, but it usually takes them a while. If things get too hot we'll leave the sleigh with ammunition, because if that goes anyone closer than thirty yards will never see his mother again."</p><p class="calibre3">I thought of the attack on the convoy near Kharkov. "Let's go," someone shouted, to prove he wasn't afraid.</p><p class="calibre3">The sergeant jumped onto the first sleigh and waved us forward. We soon reached the top of the hill. The horses, panting from the climb, stopped for a moment before dashing down the other side.</p><p class="calibre3">"Get going!" shouted the sergeant. "We can't stay here!" "Use the whip!" Hals shouted to the fellow who was driving. Our sleigh was the first to start down. I can still see our three plucky ponies jumping through the snow like rabbits, from one depression to the next, churning up a white cloud which undoubtedly was visible a long way off. The three of us huddled behind the driver, in the center of the sleigh, perched on dark green boxes which carried a disquieting inscription in white stenciled letters. We were all feeling nervous, and had forgotten the cold.</p><p class="calibre3">I tried to watch the horizon through veils of white dust, despite our jolting progress. I thought that I could dimly see a group of isbas in front of us. All around us, shell holes of a remarkable symmetry mutilated the immaculate whiteness of the slope. Despite our precipitate speed, I noticed the curious borders of these excavations, which the earth thrown up by the explosions had tinged a light yellow. They looked like enormous, stylized flowers, with dark brown centers and yellow petals which turned very pale, almost white, at their outer edges. The holes which had already been there for long enough to be partly filled by new snow made a subtle variation in this curiously decorative pattern.</p><p class="calibre3">We reached the bottom of the slope without incident. There were a few heavily damaged isbas, and several large guns almost buried in the snow.</p><p class="calibre3">We stopped beside an isba whose roof sloped right down to the ground. The wall nearest us was of open lattice, and we could see some engineers working inside. They seemed to be taking the building apart. A few men came out carrying pieces of wood. Then a plump sergeant with a white garment pulled over his coat came up to us.</p><p class="calibre3">"Unload right here," he said. "The engineers are preparing a shelter. It'll be finished in an hour."</p><p class="calibre3">A loud explosion made us jump. To our right, we saw a yellow flash, and then a geyser of stones and dirt, which spouted almost thirty feet into the air.</p><p class="calibre3">The sergeant turned calmly toward the noise. "Goddamned dirt," he said. "Harder than a rock."</p><p class="calibre3">We concluded that these fellows were engineers playing with dynamite. The corpulent noncom looked at our orders.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah," he said, tapping a box of cans with a gloved finger. "These aren't for us. But our supplies are already three days late, and we're living on our reserves which we're not supposed to touch. If this goes on . . . You truck drivers certainly take your own sweet time! That's why fellows up front die of the cold. When you haven't got anything inside, you know, you can't keep going." He slapped his belly.</p><p class="calibre3">Judging by his waistline, it was hard to imagine that he'd fasted for long. He must have had a private store of food hidden away somewhere, because it was clear that, despite our best efforts, the front lines were extremely short of supplies.</p><p class="calibre3">"You'll have to get over that way," he pointed down the track. "That section is holding a piece of the Don bank . . . and you'll go there on your hands and knees, if you know what's good for you."</p><p class="calibre3">We set off across the snow-covered chaos, following a trail marked by trucks half buried in snow. Beyond an embankment, some big guns and heavy howitzers were hidden by a heap of piled-up snow. Once we had passed them, they simply vanished from sight: their camouflage was perfect.</p><p class="calibre3">We came to a big trench in which a group of thin, shivering horses were pawing the hard ground. Some sacks of hay-so dry it was practically dust had been ripped open and put down for them. The poor animals were sniffing at the hay with their rimy nostrils, but didn't seem too tempted. A few frozen horse cadavers lay on the ground among the animals that were still standing. A handful of soldiers in long coats were watching the horses. We passed through a string of rough dugouts, and heard machine-gun fire coming from quite nearby.</p><p class="calibre3">"Machine guns!" our driver remarked, smiling strangely. "That means we're here." Trenches, foxholes, and dugouts stretched away as far as we could see in all directions. We were stopped by a patrol.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ninth Infantry Regiment, ----- company," said the lieutenant. "Is it for us?"</p><p class="calibre3">"No, Mein Leutnant. We're looking for the ---- section."</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah," said the officer. "You'll have to leave your sleighs here. The section you want is over there on the river bank, and on that little island. You'll have to stick to the trenches, and be careful, because you'll be in range of the Russian forward positions, and they wake up from time to time."</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you, Mein Leutnant." The sergeant's voice was trembling. The lieutenant called over one of the men who was with him: "Show them the way, and then come back."</p><p class="calibre3">The man saluted and joined us. Like everybody else, I had grabbed a box that was too heavy for me, and was going to carry it on my back. The sound of machine-gun fire began again, only louder.</p><p class="calibre3">"There it goes again. Is it serious or not?"</p><p class="calibre3">The gunfire grew louder, stopped, and began again, passionate and violent.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's us," our guide replied. "But wait a few minutes. You can't tell right away whether they're doing it just for laughs, or whether it's the beginning of a push onto the ice."</p><p class="calibre3">We listened to him without a word. He seemed almost relaxed in this disquieting atmosphere. We were perfect novices: our few scrapes on the "Third International" seemed liked nothing compared to what might happen here. The firing kept stopping and starting, sometimes very close. At other moments we could hear guns that were plainly further off.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals suggested that we lay our two boxes across our Mausers, to make a kind of carrying litter. We had just reorganized ourselves to put this plan into effect when we heard some heavy detonations which followed each other in rapid succession.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's the Russians," grinned the veteran, who was walking just ahead of us.</p><p class="calibre3">The air shook with the rhythm of the explosions. They seemed to be about three or four hundred yards ahead of us, to our left.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's their assault artillery.... It might be an attack." Suddenly, about thirty yards to the left, there was a sharp and violent burst of sound, followed by a curious, catlike whine, followed by a series of similar sounds. We hastily put down our burdens, and ducked, looking anxiously in all directions. The air was still for a moment.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't panic, boys," said our guide, who had also ducked. "We've got a battery of 107s behind that pile of stuff over there, and we're answering the Russians."</p><p class="calibre3">The infernal noise began again. Even though our guide had told us what it was, I could feel my stomach contracting.</p><p class="calibre3">"Put on your helmets," said the sergeant. "If the Russians spot that battery, they'll fire on it."</p><p class="calibre3">"And let's keep going," our guide added. "There isn't a quiet corner within sixty miles. We're no safer here than anywhere else." We began to move forward, bent double. The air around us shook for the third time, and we could hear gunfire all around us. The German battery was firing nonstop, and ahead the noise of the spandau was getting closer. We passed three soldiers who were unrolling a telephone wire along a footpath which crossed our route. The sound of explosions now seemed to have a regular rhythm.</p><p class="calibre3">"This might be an attack," said the soldier who had come with us. "I'll leave you here. I've got to get back to my section."</p><p class="calibre3">"Which way do we go?" asked our sergeant, who was clearly terrified.</p><p class="calibre3">"Follow the path as far as the geschnauz* (*Assault gun) over there on the right. They'll be able to tell you. But eat something first. It's lunchtime."</p><p class="calibre3">He took a few steps in the other direction, doubled over, as before. So, that is how one moves on a battlefield! A few days later I was used to it, and paid no more attention.</p><p class="calibre3">We opened our mess tins, and ate huddled in the snow. I didn't feel particularly hungry. The explosions, which made my head ring inside my icy helmet, seemed far more interesting than food.</p><p class="calibre3">Hals, who was not entirely in control of his feelings, rolled his eyes like a hunted animal, and looked at me, shaking his head.</p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe we shouldn't stop to eat . . . If an officer came along . . ."</p><p class="calibre3">A deafening salvo which seemed to be passing right over our heads interrupted us, and we instinctively hunched our shoulders and shut our eyes. Hals was about to speak again when another explosion, different in kind, but no less brutal, shook the earth, followed by a loud whistle and another explosion. This time we felt as if we were being lifted from the ground. We were shaken by a displacement of the air of an astonishing violence. Then an avalanche of stones and chunks of ice poured down on us.</p><p class="calibre3">We made ourselves as small as we could, not daring to move or speak. We had dropped our guns and our mess tins.</p><p class="calibre3">"They'll kill me!" shouted a young fellow who had hurled himself into my lap in the general confusion.</p><p class="calibre3">"They're going to kill me!" There was another loud boom, and then a deafening German salvo passed over our heads.</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's go on; we can't stay here!" yelled our sergeant, shoving his helmet further down onto his head.</p><p class="calibre3">We picked up our boxes like automatons. The trench was wide enough for four men to walk abreast, but we proceeded single file, keeping close to one of the walls. I was with Hals, directly behind the sergeant, who kept exhorting us to move.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hurry up! Quick! The Russians have spotted our battery! They can see it, and we're right beside it! This damned trench is heading right into their fire. We've got to get to that communication trench down there."</p><p class="calibre3">Every other minute we had to throw ourselves into the bottom of the trench. The heavy cases kept slipping from our icy fingers no matter how tightly we tried to hold them: it still seems astonishing that they didn't explode in our faces.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hurry up," said the sergeant, disregarding our troubles. "It's down there."</p><p class="calibre3">"Tell me," said Hals. "There's still twice as much as this on the sleighs. Do we have to bring all that too?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, of course ... I don't know.... Hurry up, for God's sake!" While the Russians were reloading, our battery had fired twice. The next Russian salvo fell about forty yards behind us, followed by two others at an indefinable distance, which nonetheless made us double over a little lower. Suddenly there was a deafening hooting sound, followed by an overwhelming noise which shook the earth and the air. One side of the trench collapsed. It all happened so quickly I had no time to duck. I remember seeing what looked like a disintegrating scarecrow flying through the rubble in a cone of flame, and falling in several pieces onto the edge of the trench, before rolling to the bottom. We were all thrown to the ground without the strength or courage to get up again.</p><p class="calibre3">"Quick! Up! We've got to get to the other trench!" shouted the sergeant, whose face was contorted by fear.</p><p class="calibre3">"If a shell lands here, it will be a volcano."</p><p class="calibre3">There were two more explosions. Our guns were firing steadily. Dragging the cases, we climbed across the debris and the body of the poor wretch who had been blown into the air. I glanced at him quickly as we went by. It was a horrible sight. His helmet had fallen down over his face, and its visor was half-buried in his chin, or neck. His heavy winter clothes were like a sack holding together something which no longer bore any resemblance to the human form. He was missing a leg-or perhaps it was doubled under him. Another body was mixed into the rubble a short way off. The Russian shell must have landed right on some poor fellows who had ducked their heads and were waiting for the storm to pass.</p><p class="calibre3">I can remember very distinctly the first deaths I encountered in the war. The thousands upon thousands which followed are blurred and faceless: a vast, cumulative nightmare which still haunts me, in which atrocious mutilations appear side by side with figures who seem to be peacefully sleeping, or with others whose eyes are opened astonishingly wide, stamped by death with an uncommunicable terror. I thought I had already experienced the limits of horror and of endurance, that I was a tough fighting man who would return home in due course to recount my heroic exploits. I have used the words and expressions which my experiences from Minsk to Kharkov to the Don suggested to me. But I should have reserved those words and expressions for what came later, even though they are not strong enough.</p><p class="calibre3">It is a mistake to use intense words without carefully weighing and measuring them, or they will have already been used when one needs them later. It's a mistake, for instance, to use the word "frightful" to describe a few broken-up companions mixed into the ground: but it's a mistake which might be forgiven.</p><p class="calibre3">I should perhaps end my account here, because my powers are inadequate for what I have to tell. Those who haven't lived through the experience may sympathize as they read, the way one sympathizes with the hero of a novel or a play, but they certainly will never understand, as one cannot understand the unexplainable. This stammering outpouring may be without interest to the sector of the world to which I now belong. However, I shall try to let my memory speak as clearly as possible. I dedicate the remainder of this account to my friends Marius and Jean-Marie Kaiser, who are in a position to understand me, as they lived through the same general events in the same part of the world. I shall try to reach and translate the deepest level of human aberration, which I never could have imagined, which I never would have thought possible, if I hadn't known it firsthand.</p><p class="calibre3">We reached the communications trench, which had seemed like safety to our sergeant, and literally dived into it as a brutal burst of fire scattered the soil beyond the parapet. The two men in white overalls who were already there jumped up in astonishment.</p><p class="calibre3">One of them had been standing beside the gun surveying the scene through field glasses. The other, hunched down at the bottom of the hole, had been fiddling with the knobs of a radio apparatus.</p><p class="calibre3">"The ---section?" asked our sergeant, puffing for breath. "We've got some supplies for them."</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not very far," said the soldier with the field glasses, "but you won't be able to get there right now; you'd only be blown up. Put your explosives down-but not right here-and use the bunker." He smiled.</p><p class="calibre3">Without waiting for him to repeat the invitation, we slid down into a tomblike structure of boards and hard earth, which was almost without light. Inside, there were four soldiers dressed in white. One of them had somehow managed to go to sleep. The others were writing beside a flickering candle.</p><p class="calibre3">The bunker wasn't high enough for us to stand, and everyone had to move over so we could get in, but we were, at any rate, something new.</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it solid?" Hals asked, pointing his tattered finger at the roof of the rathole.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well ... if something lands a little closer, it might collapse," one of the soldiers answered mockingly.</p><p class="calibre3">"And if something lands square on us, our pals won't have to bury us," added another.</p><p class="calibre3">How could they joke? Habit, probably. The fellow who had been asleep woke up and yawned.</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought they'd sent us some women."</p><p class="calibre3">"No . . . just a bunch of kids. Where did you find this brood, sergeant?"</p><p class="calibre3">We all laughed.</p><p class="calibre3">As if to rub our noses in our situation, the ground shook again. From here the noise was less violent.</p><p class="calibre3">"These boys are new recruits, part of the supply train, and they've crossed the whole of Russia so you can fill your stomachs."</p><p class="calibre3">"That's nothing," said the fellow who'd just waked up.</p><p class="calibre3">"We've been sweating it out here for three months already, while you were taking your own sweet time. I know they've got pretty girls in the Ukraine, but you shouldn't have stayed there so long. We've been dying of hunger."</p><p class="calibre3">I ventured a few words in my atrocious German:</p><p class="calibre3">"Girls! We didn't see any girls! All we saw was snow."</p><p class="calibre3">"Alsatian?" somebody asked.</p><p class="calibre3">"No, he's French," Hals answered, joking.</p><p class="calibre3">Everyone burst out laughing. Hals was taken aback, and didn't know what to say.</p><p class="calibre3">"Merci," the questioner added with a good accent, holding out his hand to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ma mere est allemande," I replied.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ach, gut. Votre mutter ist Deutsche? Sehr gut."</p><p class="calibre3">The ground shook again. Some pieces from the ceiling rattled down onto our helmets.</p><p class="calibre3">"Things don't seem to be going very well here," said our sergeant, whose mind was absorbed by his terror, and who plainly didn't give a damn whether my mother was German or Chinese.</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, they're just having fun," the other one said. "The beating they took three days ago really calmed them down."</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. Those bastards made us re-cross the Don about a month ago. We had to give up at least forty miles. Now our front is on the west bank. They've tried to cross on the ice at least four times already. The last time was five days ago. Then you would really have seen something. They attacked for two days, especially at night. It was really pretty rough. You see how I am today: I'm trying to catch up on my sleep. We haven't had much lately. We're supposed to counterattack too, but nothing's happened yet. Take a look through the glasses. The ice is still covered with Russians. The pigs don't even pick up their wounded. I'll bet some of them down there are still groaning."</p><p class="calibre3">"We're supposed to resupply the ---- section," our wretched sergeant explained anxiously.</p><p class="calibre3">"You'll find them a little further on-right down on the river bank-real daredevils. I think they've got the little island too. They lost it one night when they had to fight hand to hand, but in the morning they took it back. It's a pretty tight spot down there, I can tell you. I'd rather be where I am."</p><p class="calibre3">Our battery had been silent for a few minutes, but the Russian shells were still coming over at a slow but regular pace. The soldier with the field glasses came in, hunched up and blowing on his fingers.</p><p class="calibre3">"Your turn," he said to one of the soldiers. "I'm shaking so hard I'm afraid my teeth will fall out."</p><p class="calibre3">The man he called got up with a groan, and pushed his way through to the exit.</p><p class="calibre3">"Our guns aren't firing any more. Have they been destroyed?" our sergeant asked the newcomer.</p><p class="calibre3">"You've got some funny ideas," the soldier replied, still rubbing his fingers.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'd be in a fine fix without them. A few days ago, we'd have just been overrun without those guns. I sincerely hope that all our comrades of the 107th are still among the living."</p><p class="calibre3">"I do too," our sergeant agreed emphatically, realizing that he'd said the wrong thing. "But why have they stopped firing?"</p><p class="calibre3">"You should know how tight supplies are. We have to fire drop by drop, so to speak, or when we know we can't miss. The infantry and the artillery both have to economize on munitions to the maximum. But we can't let the Soviets know that, so from time to time we give them a heavy dose . . . you see?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I see."</p><p class="calibre3">"They're not shooting any more," said someone in our group.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. It's quieted down. You'd better make the most of it," said one of the soldiers from the geschnauz.</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's go, children," said our sergeant, who seemed to have regained some confidence.</p><p class="calibre3">Children ... he wasn't far wrong: we seemed like children beside these Don veterans. A few rounds from the big guns had seemed to us like the end of the world. There was a great difference between the proud soldiers we'd been in Poland, marching smartly through the villages with our guns slung, and what we were now. How many times in the past I had thought myself invulnerable, filled with the pride we all felt, admiring our shoulder straps and helmets and magnificent uniforms-and the sound of our footsteps, which I loved, and love still, despite everything. But here, by the banks of the Don, we seemed like nothing, like bundles of rags which each sheltered a small, trembling creature. We were underfed and unbelievably filthy. The immensity of Russia seemed to have absorbed us, and as truck drivers we were not dashing figures, but more like the junior maidservants of the army. We were dying of cold like everybody else, only our plight was never mentioned.</p><p class="calibre3">We left the shelter timidly, glancing toward the nearby parapet which screened off the war, and picked up our dangerous burdens. Everything seemed to have calmed down. There was no more noise, and the light in the sky had become less brilliant. We took a zigzag line of trenches, which ran parallel to the point we had to reach. Everywhere there were shelters filled with half-frozen soldiers trying to warm themselves beside those miraculous gasoline lamp-heaters, and everywhere we were greeted by the same question: "Any mail?" Three Messerschmitts passed overhead, and were greeted by a loud cheer. The confidence which the infantry placed in the Luftwaffe was absolute, and on innumerable occasions the familiar shapes of the planes with the black crosses restored faltering courage and frustrated a Russian attack.</p><p class="calibre3">Several times, as we moved forward, we had to press ourselves against the side of the trench so that stretcher-bearers carrying wounded could get through. We were drawing close to the outermost limit of the German lines. The trenches grew progressively narrower and shallower, so that eventually we became a kind of human chain, bent nearly double in order to remain unseen. Several times, I sneaked a look over the parapet. Some sixty yards ahead, I could see the tall grass on the river bank, stiff with frost; and somewhere in that space was the section we were supposed to supply.</p><p class="calibre3">Now we were advancing half exposed, setting off slides of earth and snow as we jumped from one hole to the next. We clattered down into a huge crater, where an orderly in heavy winter clothes was bandaging two fellows who were clenching their teeth to keep themselves from crying out. He told us we had reached our destination. We wasted no time inspecting the situation of this cursed section, but put our cases in the hole we were shown, and turned back for another trip.</p><p class="calibre3">By nightfall we had completed what we later learned to call the "priority" supply of this front-line section. Nothing had happened since the bombardment of the afternoon, and the unfortunate soldiers on the Don were preparing themselves for another icy night. Although the temperature had risen a little, it was still very cold.</p><p class="calibre3">We were waiting for two of our men who were collecting the scattering of letters these soldiers had managed to write. Hals, another soldier, and I were sitting on a mound of frost-hardened earth, hidden from enemy eyes.</p><p class="calibre3">"I wonder where we'll be sleeping tonight," said Hals, staring at his boots.</p><p class="calibre3">"Outdoors, I guess," our companion answered. "I don't see any hotels around here."</p><p class="calibre3">"Come over this way," called someone else from our group. "You can see the river very well from here."</p><p class="calibre3">We got up from the ground to look through a heap of frosty branches that camouflaged a spandau aimed and ready to fire.</p><p class="calibre3">"Look," Hals said. "Bodies lying on the ice."</p><p class="calibre3">There were numbers of motionless bodies, victims of the fighting of a few days earlier. The soldiers at the geschnauz had not been exaggerating: the Russians had not removed their dead.</p><p class="calibre3">I tried to see further into the distance, to what must be the island we had heard so much about, but this was difficult, as it was growing dark. I could recognize only vaguely what looked like snow-covered trees. Our soldiers must be crouched among them, watching in the silence, with every sense alert. Beyond, in the heavy, unbreathable mist falling across this mournful landscape, the far bank was almost invisible. On this bank, the German advance had been halted, and Russian soldiers were watching for us.</p><p class="calibre3">I had reached the front line, the line I had thought about with such dread and had been so curious to see. For the moment, nothing was happening. The silence was almost complete, broken only by occasional voices. I thought I could see a few thin streams of smoke rising through the mist on the Russian side. Then some other soldiers pushed me aside.</p><p class="calibre3">"If it interests you so much," said one of the grenadiers standing at the foot of the spandau, "I'll gladly give you my place. I've had enough of this cold."</p><p class="calibre3">We didn't know what to say. His place was certainly not very enviable.</p><p class="calibre3">A lieutenant in a long hooded coat jumped into our hole. Before we had time to salute, he lifted a pair of field glasses, and stared into the distance. A few seconds later, we heard the sound of heavy detonations coming from behind us.</p><p class="calibre3">Almost at once, there were explosions on the ice, immediately reproduced by a long, repetitive echo, and then a sharp whistling sound which rang through the air very close to us. The entire German front responded immediately. The noise of the guns became indistinguishable from the explosion of their projectiles. We all dropped to the bottom of the hole. We felt lost, and stared at each other with anguished, questioning eyes.</p><p class="calibre3">"They're attacking," someone said.</p><p class="calibre3">The two machine gunners didn't fire right away, but stayed beside the lieutenant, staring at the Don. Some of the explosions were loud and strident; others sounded heavy, and as if they were coming from under ground. Finally, the grenadier who had so generously offered his place decided to speak to us: "The ice is breaking more easily tonight; it's not so cold. Pretty soon they'll have to swim over."</p><p class="calibre3">We all hung on his words, as none of us understood what was happening.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll send out the lightest one here," he said. "If the ice holds his weight, we'll have to blow it up."</p><p class="calibre3">"He's the lightest," said Hals with a constricted laugh, pointing to a cringing, very young soldier.</p><p class="calibre3">"What will I have to do?" the boy asked, white with anxiety. "Nothing just yet," the gunner said jokingly.</p><p class="calibre3">The bombardment stopped as suddenly as it had begun. The lieutenant looked out through his glasses for a few more minutes, then climbed over the parapet and vanished. We stayed where we were, without moving or speaking. To break the anxious silence, our sergeant ordered us to open our mess tins and eat dinner, while we waited for the fellows with the mail.</p><p class="calibre3">We swallowed down our tasteless, frozen portions without much appetite. As I chewed I went over to the spandau to look down once more at the river.</p><p class="calibre3">What I saw explained the German bombardment of a few moments ago. Great blocks of ice, some of them two feet thick, were standing up at right angles to the surface of the river. These ice blocks, partly broken and crushed, formed steep hills of ice, whose crests oscillated with the rhythm of the current beneath the frozen surface. The German gunners fired on the ice every night to deny access to the incessant Soviet patrols, who nonetheless exposed themselves to great danger on these moving blocks. Now the broken ice was rearing up and crashing into other pieces with a strange, heavy sound. New fissures were opening, and the night was filled with the noises of cracking, breaking ice.</p><p class="calibre3">I stood for a long time, transfixed by the unreal vision, gradually noticing that hundreds of lights were springing up on the east bank. With my eye glued to the loophole, I stared at these lights, which seemed to be growing stronger.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey," I shouted at the two regulars, "something's happening!" They rushed over to me, pushing me aside so they could see. I stayed where I was, shoving my head between theirs.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hell, you really scared us," one of them said. "That's nothing; they do it every night. The Popovs like to make us think they're warming up. Not at all a bad idea, either. Those lights are a damned nuisance. Look how hard it is to see the river now. Even flares make it hard."</p><p class="calibre3">I couldn't tear myself away from this disquieting vision. All along the vast horizon, the Russians had lit hundreds of braziers, not to warm themselves, because they must certainly have kept their distance from them, but to dazzle our observers. And in fact, when the eye traveled to the east bank, it remained fixed on those fires. Everything else, by contrast, was plunged into darkness, and this enabled the enemy to effect numerous changes which we could deduce only with difficulty. We were able to see a little with flares, but their radiance, although intense, was reduced at least to half strength by the enemy's arrangement of alternating light and darkness.</p><p class="calibre3">I would have stood and stared much longer if our sergeant hadn't given the signal for departure. We had no trouble returning to the rear. The night, undisturbed by the noises of war, hid our movements perfectly.</p><p class="calibre3">Everywhere, soldiers were curled up in their holes. Those who were asleep had covered themselves with everything they could find, leaving no fraction of themselves exposed-not a nose, or the tip of an ear. One needed to be accustomed to this strange mode of existence to know that beneath these mounds of cloth subtle human mechanisms were managing to survive and garner their strength.</p><p class="calibre3">Others were playing cards in the depths of their lairs, or writing letters in the flickering light of a candle, or of a lamp-heater. These marvelous objects-and I call them "marvelous" deliberately-were about two feet high, and would operate on gasoline or kerosene: one simply had to regulate the nozzle and the intake of air. A reflector behind a glass projected the light. A story had it that the army was working on an improved model which would also dispense beer.</p><p class="calibre3">Those who were neither asleep, on guard, playing cards, or writing letters were absorbing the alcohol which was freely distributed along with our ammunition.</p><p class="calibre3">"There's as much vodka, schnapps and Terek liquor on the front as there are Paks," I was told later by a wounded infantryman who was waiting for evacuation on the hospital train. "It's the easiest way to make heroes. Vodka purges the brain and expands the strength. I've been doing nothing but drink for two days now. It's the best way to forget that I've got seven pieces of metal in my gut, if you can believe the doctor."</p><p class="calibre3">We got back to our two sleighs without incident.</p><p class="calibre3">"Am I dreaming," Hals said, "or has it grown warmer? I'm sweating like an ox in these clothes. Maybe I've got a fever: that's all I need."</p><p class="calibre3">"Then I've got one too," I said. "I'm soaking wet."</p><p class="calibre3">"That's because you had the balls scared off you today," said the fellow who earlier in the afternoon had shouted, "They'll kill me!" "Listen to who's talking," Hals said. "You're still as green as your clothes, and you think you can judge us."</p><p class="calibre3">Our sleighs were now carrying six wounded as well as ourselves. Although they were less heavily loaded than they had been, they ran less smoothly. The little horses were clearly having a hard time: we could almost see the snow growing softer as we looked at it. The wind was carrying large flakes of melting snow, which soon changed to rain. This milder air, after such terrible cold, seemed to us like the Cote d'Azur.</p><p class="calibre3">It took us two hours to reach our huts in the rear lines, and we needed no urging to fling ourselves onto our rough pallets. However, despite the physical and emotional exhaustion of that wearing day, I wasn't able to sleep immediately. I kept seeing the banks of the Don, and hearing the whine of enemy projectiles, and the explosions, whose violence I would never have been able to imagine. For me, whose eardrums were shattered by the firing of a Mauser, our Polish exercises now seemed like the most trifling of games.</p><p class="calibre3">The infantry on the west bank had to fight as well as survive: that was the difference between them and us. We had been promised that we would be as honored as the infantry, as combat troops, if we distinguished ourselves on our supply missions. This promise, which had been made to us on behalf of our commander at the Wagenlager near Minsk, was clearly addressed to young recruits like Hals, Lensen, Olensheim, and me. We had taken it as an honor, and were proud of the confidence which had been placed in us.</p><p class="calibre3">Yet the reports in the front-line journal blamed us squarely, almost making us responsible for the German retreat from the Caucasus, and back beyond Rostov. For lack of supplies these troops had been forced to abandon territories won with great sacrifices, so that they would not suffer the same fate as the defenders of Stalingrad. In their exhortations to us, our officers often asked us to achieve a certain goal despite adverse conditions, at whatever the cost, to do more than was humanly possible, to face the prospect of the worst, including death. We had thought that we had accomplished more than the bare minimum. In fact, despite our unstinted efforts, and all our bitter moments, we had achieved somewhat less than half of what had been expected. Maybe we should have given our lives too.</p><p class="calibre3">"Absolute sacrifice" was what the High Command called it. These words made my head spin, as I stared with wide eyes into the impenetrable darkness, sinking gradually into sleep, as into a large black pit.</p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><a id="filepos224144" class="calibre5"></a><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE MARCH TO THE REAR</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold">From the Don to Kharkov</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold">First Spring First Retreat</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Donetz Battle</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre3">For three or four more days, we were involved in occupations of more or less the same kind. The snow was melting everywhere, and the cold was lessening as rapidly as it had increased-which seemed to be the way of Russian seasons. From implacable winter one was shifted into torrid summer, with no spring in between. The thaw did not improve our military situation, but made it worse. The temperature rose from five degrees below zero to forty degrees above, melting the unimaginable ocean of snow which had accumulated all winter.</p><p class="calibre3">Enormous pools of water and swampy patches appeared everywhere in the partly melted snow. For the Wehrmacht, which had endured the horrors of five winter months, this softening of the temperature fell like a blessing from heaven. With or without orders, we took off our filthy overcoats and began a general cleanup. Men plunged naked into the icy waters of these temporary ponds for the sake of a wash. No gunfire disturbed the tranquil air, which was sometimes even sunny.</p><p class="calibre3">The war itself, whose indefinable presence we still felt, seemed to have grown less savage. I had made the acquaintance of a sympathetic fellow, a noncom in the engineers, whose section was temporarily billeted in the hut opposite ours. He came from Kehl, right across the Rhine from</p><p class="calibre3">Strasbourg, and knew France better than his own country. He spoke perfect French. My conversations with him, which were always in French, were like rest periods after the painstaking gibberish I was forced into with my other companions. Hals often joined us to improve his French in the same way I tried to improve my German.</p><p class="calibre3">Ernst Neubach-my new friend-seemed to be a born engineer. He had no equal in his ability to knock a few old boards into a shelter as weatherproof as one a fully-equipped mason might build. He made a shower from the gas tank of a large tractor, and it functioned miraculously, with a lamp-heater continuously warming its forty gallons of water. The first men to use this shower unfortunately received a tepid downpour of water flavored with gasoline. Although we rinsed the tank repeatedly, the water remained tainted for a long time.</p><p class="calibre3">In the evenings waiting to use the shower there was always a crowd of shouting, pushing men which often included our superiors. Priority was awarded to whoever produced the largest number of cigarettes, or a portion of the bread ration. Our feldwebel, Laus, once paid three hundred cigarettes. The showers always began after the five-o'clock meal and continued late into the night in an atmosphere of rowdy horseplay. Those who got through the showers first often found themselves tossed onto their backsides in the liquid mud which flooded the outskirts of the camp. Here we had no curfew or other barracks regulations. Once all the day's work was done, we were free to joke and drink for the whole night, if we wanted to.</p><p class="calibre3">We spent about a week in this way, with quiet, uneventful days. Each fatigue party obliged us to flounder through a sea of increasingly sticky mud. We made three trips back to the front; each time it was unbelievably quiet. On horseback or in carts, we took supplies to our troops, whose laundry was spread out to dry on all the parapets. Across the Don, the Russians appeared to be similarly engaged.</p><p class="calibre3">We spoke to a bearded soldier and asked him if everything was going well. He laughed. "The war must be over. Hitler and Stalin have made it up. I've never seen it so calm for so long. The Popovs do nothing but drink all day and sing all night. They have terrific nerve, too, walking around in the open air, right under our guns. Werk saw three of them going to get water from the river, just like that. Didn't you, Werk?" He turned to a sly-faced soldier who was washing his feet in a puddle.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes," Werk said. "We just couldn't shoot them. For once, let's all stick our noses out without getting a bullet between the eyes."</p><p class="calibre3">A feeling of joy and hope had begun to take hold. Could the war be over?</p><p class="calibre3">"It really might be," Hals said. "The fellows on the front are always the last to be told anything like that. If it's true, we'll know in a few days. You'll see, Sajer. Maybe we'll all be going home soon. We'll have a terrific celebration. It's almost too good to be true!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't count your chickens before they're hatched," said one of the older men from the Rollbahn. His realism damped us down a little. As usual, we set off down the track-more accurately, canal-of liquid mud which led to our camp. We stopped a moment to talk to Ernst, whose section was trying to restore the track to a usable condition.</p><p class="calibre3">"If it goes on this way," he said, "we'll have to take to boats. Two trucks came through here, and the stones we broke our backs shoving into the mud completely disappeared. It must be nice down in the trenches."</p><p class="calibre3">"They're in a mess," Hals said. "And their morale is really terrible, too. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they broke up their guns for kindling. Our fellows and the Popovs are having a real spree down there."</p><p class="calibre3">"Well let them make the most of it," Ernst said. "There's something funny going on. That radio truck over there is taking messages nonstop. And messengers all the time, too. The last one had to leave his scooter and wade in here to bring the Kommandant his message."</p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe it was congratulations for your showers," said Hals.</p><p class="calibre3">"That would be fine by me, but I doubt it. When those fellows run around like that, everybody else will too, before you know it." "Defeatist," Hals shouted as we left.</p><p class="calibre3">When we got back to the camp, nothing seemed to have changed. We devoured the steaming mess the cook served up and prepared for another evening of larking. Then Laus blew the whistle for assembly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Lord," I thought. "Neubach was right. Here we go again."</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not going to say anything about the way you look," Laus said. "Just pack up. We could be moving out of here any time now. Got it?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Fuck," someone said. "It was too good to last."</p><p class="calibre3">"You didn't think you could just sit here and fart, did you? There's a war on."</p><p class="calibre3">"Packing up" meant that we had to be ready for inspection, with our uniforms in impeccable order, and all our straps and buckles polished and fastened in the prescribed manner. At least, that is what it had meant at Chemnitz and Bialystok. Here, of course, that kind of discipline was somewhat relaxed, but it all still depended on the humor of the inspecting officer, who could quibble at anything from the inside of a gun barrel to the state of our toes, and impose heavy details, or endless guard duty.</p><p class="calibre3">I could still remember only too well the four hours of punishment handed out to me a few days after I had arrived at Chemnitz. The lieutenant had drawn a circle on the cement of the courtyard, which was fully exposed to the sun. Then I had to put on the "punishment pack"-a knapsack filled with sand, which weighed nearly eighty pounds. I weighed one hundred and thirty. After two hours, my helmet was burning hot from the sun, and by the end I needed all my will power to keep my knees from buckling. I had nearly fainted several times. That is how I learned that a good soldier does not cross the barracks yard with his hands in his pockets.</p><p class="calibre3">So we rushed to get our gear in order, and frantically polished our sodden leather boots.</p><p class="calibre3">"And before we've walked ten yards, all this will be for nothing!" It took us a good hour to make our kit more or less respectable. Then we had another twenty-four before our country holiday on the Don was transformed into a nightmare.</p><p class="calibre3">The day after our sprucing-up, I was put on guard duty and given the period from midnight until 2:30 A.M. I had summoned up all my patience, and was standing on the platform of empty munitions cases which had been put there so the sentry wouldn't sink into the mud. Beside the platform, a foxhole half filled with water was ready to receive the guard responsible for the stocks of gasoline-in this case, myself.</p><p class="calibre3">The night was mild. A rainy wind blew fat white clouds rapidly across the sky, occasionally revealing a large white moon. To my right, the outlines of our vehicles and the camp buildings stood out sharply. Ahead of me, the enormous dark, hilly horizon melted into the sky. As the crow flies, the Don lay about five miles from our first line of German reserves. Between us and the river, some thousands of men were sleeping in conditions of almost unimaginable squalor. The sound of engines came to us on the wind. Both sides used the dark for moving supplies and troops. Two of the sentries patrolling our perimeter came by, and we exchanged the usual formalities. One of the men told a joke. I was about to reply when the whole horizon, from north to south, was suddenly lit by a series of brilliant flashes.</p><p class="calibre3">Then there was a second series of flickering intensity, and I thought I felt the earth shake, as the air filled with a sound like thunder. "Lord! It's an attack!" shouted one of the men on patrol. "I think it's them!"</p><p class="calibre3">We could already hear whistles in the camp and voices shouting orders through the still-distant noise of explosions. Groups of men went by on the run. Artillerymen who had been asleep were running to their guns on the edge of the abandoned airfield. As no one had told me to leave my post, I stayed where I was, wondering what would be asked of my comrades. A supply expedition through such a heavy bombardment would be an operation of an entirely different kind from the ones we had recently grown used to. The bursts of distant fire continued, mixed with the sound of our guns. Flashes of light, closer and more brilliant than before, turned the groups of men running through pools of water into shadow puppets.</p><p class="calibre3">It was as if a giant, in a fit of terrible fury, were shaking the universe, reducing each man to a ludicrous fragment which the colossus of war could trample without even noticing. Despite the relative distance of danger, I bent double, ready to plunge into my water-filled hole at a moment's notice. Two big crawler tractors came toward me, with all their lights out. Their wheels and treads had churned the mud into a kind of liquid sludge. Two men jumped down, and almost disappeared in it.</p><p class="calibre3">"Give us a hand, guard," one of them called. They were splattered with mud right up to their helmets.</p><p class="calibre3">The bombardment continued to enflame the earth and sky, as we loaded some drums of gasoline onto their machine.</p><p class="calibre3">"There's always something to fart in your face," one of them said to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Good luck," I answered.</p><p class="calibre3">Further off, the soldiers in my unit were rounding up the nervous, jostling horses, which kept falling in the mud and whinnying frantically. Several times, trucks came to collect drums of gasoline, so that by day break, when my relief hadn't appeared, I wondered how much there was left for me to guard. The bombardment was almost as strong as ever. I felt exhausted and confused. A group of boys from my company came by, led by a sergeant who waved me over to join them. At that moment precisely, one of the first Soviet long-range shells landed about a hundred yards behind us. The explosion shook us, and we all started to run as hard as we could. I didn't ask any questions, but looked in vain for the broad shoulders of Hals.</p><p class="calibre3">Other projectiles were now falling on the camp, which was lit up everywhere. We had thrown ourselves onto the ground, and stood up again covered with mud.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't dive like that," said the sergeant. "You're always late. Keep your eye on me, and do what I do."</p><p class="calibre3">A significant howl filled our ears, and all twelve of us, the sergeant included, plunged into the liquid mess. An enormous explosion sucked all the air from our lungs, and a simultaneous wave of mud washed over us.</p><p class="calibre3">We stood up again, soaked with filth, and wearing the pinched smiles of civilians who climb unscathed from a bad wreck. Three or four more bursts quite nearby forced us down again. Behind us, something was burning. As soon as we could, we ran to the nearest munitions dump.</p><p class="calibre3">The sight of this mountain of canvas-covered boxes made our stomachs turn over. If anything hit it, no one within a hundred yards would have a chance.</p><p class="calibre3">"Good God," said the sergeant. "There's nobody here. It's incredible."</p><p class="calibre3">With no apparent thought of danger, he climbed onto the hill of dynamite, and began to check the numbers on the boxes, which indicated their next destination. We stood and watched him, petrified, like condemned prisoners, with our feet apart, and our heads empty, waiting for orders. Two fellows soaked through, like us, came running up. The sergeant began to shout at them from his eminence. They snapped to attention despite the thunder of the guns.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you supposed to be on duty here?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, Herr Sergeant," they answered in unison. "Then where were you?"</p><p class="calibre3">"The call of nature," one of them said.</p><p class="calibre3">"You went off to crap like that, both of you at once? Idiots! We've got too much trouble here for fun and games. Your names and units." The sergeant had not climbed down.</p><p class="calibre3">Silently, I cursed this animal with his niggling discipline, who stood there preparing a report, as if nothing unusual were happening. Fresh explosions which sounded very close threw us all onto the ground except the sergeant, who continued to provoke Providence.</p><p class="calibre3">"They're cleaning up our rear," he said. "They must have let loose their goddamned infantry. Get your fat tails up here and help me!"</p><p class="calibre3">Half paralyzed by fear, we climbed onto the volcano. The flashes of light all around us lit our bodies in a tragic glare. A few moments later, we were running as hard as we could, oblivious of the weight of the cases, in our anxiety to get away.</p><p class="calibre3">Daylight had now begun to rob the spectacle of some of its brilliance. The flashes of light were scarcely visible, and the horizon was shrouded by a dense cloud of smoke, irregularly punctuated by darker plumes. Toward noon, our artillery began to fire. We were still running from job to job, although we were nearly dropping with exhaustion. I can remember sitting in a huge crater which had been dried out by an explosion, staring at the long barrel of a 155 spitting fire with rhythmic regularity. I had found Hals and Lensen, and we were sitting together, with our hands over our ears. Hals was smiling, and nodding at each explosion.</p><p class="calibre3">For two days we had practically no sleep. The dance of death continued. We were carrying the growing number of wounded to shelters half filled with water, and laying them on hastily improvised stretchers made of branches. The orderlies administered first aid. Soon these rough infirmaries, filled with the groans of the wounded, were overflowing, and we had to put fresh casualties outside, on the mud. The surgeons operated on the dying men then and there. I saw horrifying things at these collection points-vaguely human trunks which seemed to be made of blood and mud.</p><p class="calibre3">On the morning of the third day, the battle intensified. We were all gray with fatigue. The shelling went on until dusk, and then, inside of an hour, stopped. Clouds of smoke were rising all along the battered front. We felt as if we could smell the presence of death-and by this I don't mean the process of decomposition, but the smell that emanates from death when its proportions have reached a certain magnitude. Anyone who has been on a battlefield will know what I mean.</p><p class="calibre3">Two of the eight huts that made up our camp had been reduced to ashes. The ones that remained standing were overflowing with wounded. Laus-who had a good heart when the chips were down saw that we were foundering, and allowed us each an hour or two of sleep, as he could. We dropped to the ground wherever we were, as if felled by sleep. When our time was up, and we were shaken awake, we felt as though we'd only been asleep for a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre3">With exhaustion threatening to overwhelm us again, we returned to the nightmare of carrying agonized, mutilated men, or laying out rows of horribly burned bodies, which we had to search for their identity tags. These were then sent to the families of the deceased with the citation "Fallen like a hero on the field of honor for Germany and for the Fuhrer."</p><p class="calibre3">Despite the thousands of dead and wounded, the last battle fought by the German army on the Don was celebrated the day after the shooting stopped. The mouths of dying men were pried open so that they could toast this Pyrrhic victory with vodka. On a front approximately forty miles long, General Zhukov, with the help of the accursed "Siberia" Army, which had just contributed to the German defeat at Stalingrad, had been trying to break the Don line south of Voronezh. Instead, the furious Russian assaults had broken against our solidly held lines. Thousands of Soviet soldiers had paid with their lives for this abortive effort which had also cost us very dear.</p><p class="calibre3">Three-quarters of my company left that evening. The trucks were jammed with wounded, who were lying almost in piles. I was separated from Hals and Lensen for the moment: a separation I never liked. Friendships counted for a great deal during the war, their value perhaps increased by the generalized hate, consolidating men on the same side in friendships which never would have broken through the barriers of ordinary peacetime life. I found myself alone with a couple of men who may have been more or less interesting, but with whom I never had the chance to talk. As soon as I could, I abandoned them for a truck seat on which I attempted to regain some of my strength.</p><p class="calibre3">The assembly whistle rang in my ears very early the next morning. I opened my eyes. The truck cab had made an excellent bed, more or less the right size, and I felt at last as though I'd had some sleep. But exhaustion had stiffened my muscles, and despite my sleep, I had a terrible time pulling myself onto my feet. Lining up outside, I saw the same exhausted, disheveled look on almost every face.</p><p class="calibre3">Even Laus wasn't feeling particularly energetic: he had slept with his equipment like all the rest of us. He told us that we were going to leave this area for a point farther west. As a preliminary, we should stand by to help the engineers load up, or destroy what we weren't taking with us. We filed past a big kettle from which we were served a hot liquid that made no pretense to being coffee, and went to join the engineers.</p><p class="calibre3">We were sent out with donkeys, under orders to range widely, picking up all the ammunition we could find, so that it wouldn't fall into the hands of the enemy. The departure seemed to be general. Long lines of infantry caked with filth were marching away from this sea of mud, to the west. At first we thought we were being replaced, but this proved to be untrue. The entire Wehrmacht along the western bank of the Don had been ordered to withdraw. We couldn't grasp the logic of following a heroic three-day resistance with retreat.</p><p class="calibre3">Most of us were unaware that the Eastern Front had entirely changed since January. After the fall of Stalingrad, a strong Soviet push had reached the outskirts of Kharkov, re-crossed the Donetz, and moved on to Rostov, almost cutting the German retreat from the Caucasus. Troops there had been forced to return to the Crimea by way of the Sea of Azov, with heavy losses. Our periodical Ost Front and Panzer Wolfram reported that there had been heavy fighting at Kharkov, Kuban, and even Anapa.</p><p class="calibre3">We never heard a frank admission of retreat, and as most soldiers had never studied Russian geography we had very little idea of what was happening. Nevertheless, a glance at any map was enough to inform us that the west bank of the Don was the easternmost German line in Russian territory. Luckily for us, the High Command ordered our retreat before an encirclement from the north and south could cut us off from our bases at Belgorod and Kharkov. The Don was no longer one of our defenses; it had been crossed both in the north and in the south. The thought that we might have been trapped, like the defenders of Stalingrad, still makes my blood run cold.</p><p class="calibre3">For two days, the landser* (* Infantry) had been pulling out-either on foot or loaded in trucks. Soon only a small section of the Panzergruppe was left at the nearly empty camp. The passage of vehicles and men had turned the Luftwaffe field into an extraordinary quagmire: thousands of trucks, tanks, tractors, and men rolled and tramped for two days and two nights through terrain running with streams of mud.</p><p class="calibre3">We were in the middle of this syrup, trying to reorganize the materiel we had to abandon. The engineers were working with us, preparing to dynamite the ammunition we had heaped against the huts, over the carcasses of eight dismantled trucks. Toward noon, we organized a fireworks display which any municipality might have envied. Carts, sleighs, and buildings were all dynamited and burned. Two heavy howitzers which the tractors hadn't been able to pull from the mire were loaded with shells of any caliber. Then we poured any explosive that came to hand into their tubes, and shut the breech as best we could. The howitzers were split in two by the explosions, scattering showers of lethal shrapnel. We felt exhilarated, filled with the spirit of destructive delight. In the evening, the spandaus stopped a few Soviet patrols, who had undoubtedly come to see what was happening. During our last hour, we were under light artillery fire, which caused us a certain emotion. Then we left.</p><p class="calibre3">After the period of light artillery fire, the troops covering the Panzergruppe signaled several enemy penetrations into our former positions. A hasty departure order was given. We were no longer organized to hold off the Russians for any length of time. I was carrying my belongings, looking for a vehicle, when our feld assigned me to a truck we had captured from the enemy which was now carrying our wounded.</p><p class="calibre3">"Step on the gas!" he shouted. "We're getting out!"</p><p class="calibre3">Every soldier in the Wehrmacht was supposed to know how to drive. I had been given some idea of how to handle military vehicles during my training in Poland, but on machines of a very different kind. However, as one never discussed orders, I jumped into the driver's seat of the Tatra. In front of me, the dashboard presented an array of dials whose needles uniformly pointed down, a few buttons, and a series of words in indecipherable characters. The engineers had just attached the heavy truck to the back of a Mark 4. We would be leaving instantly; it was essential that I get the wretched machine to start. I considered climbing out and confessing my incapacity, but repressed the idea on reflection that they might assign me to something more difficult, or even leave me behind, to get out on my own feet as best I could.</p><p class="calibre3">If I couldn't move, I would be captured by the Bolsheviks-a thought which terrified me. I pawed frantically at the dashboard, and was blessed by a miracle. My desperate eye fell on Ernst, who was clearly looking for a lift. I felt saved.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ernst!" I shouted. "Over here! I've got room!" My friend joyfully jumped aboard.</p><p class="calibre3">"I was ready to hang on to the back of a tank," he said. "Thanks for the seat."</p><p class="calibre3">"Ernst," I asked in a voice of supplication. "Do you know how these damned things work?"</p><p class="calibre3">"You're a fine fellow, sitting here when you don't know the first thing about it!"</p><p class="calibre3">I had no time to explain. The powerful engine of the tank to which we were attached was already roaring. Hurriedly, we pulled at the controls. From the turret, one of the tank men signaled to me to put the truck in gear at the same time as the tank, to reduce the jolt for the wounded. Neubach pulled a lever under the dashboard, and we felt a responding throb from under the hood. I pressed down hard on the accelerator, and the engine made a series of loud bangs.</p><p class="calibre3">"Gently," the feld shouted at me. I smiled, nodded, and let up on the pedal. The chain stretched taut, and we increased our speed. How fast were we going? I had no idea. I knew with certainty only that we were not in reverse. The heavy truck took off with a brusque jolt, producing a chorus of groans and curses behind me.</p><p class="calibre3">Later on, in France, a pretentious bastard undertook to instruct me on a wretched Renault 4 CV, with all the airs of a commander of an ocean liner. I had to sit through a course of ludicrous demonstrations to receive a scrap of pink paper declaring me competent to drive an automobile. I didn't waste any time explaining that I had driven through Russia on a track which was more like a river than a road, fastened to a huge tank whose jolts were a constant threat to the front of my machine, which I felt certain would be wrenched off.</p><p class="calibre3">He would never have believed me. By that time I belonged to the Victorious Allies, who were all heroes, like every French soldier I met after the war. Only victors have stories to tell. We, the vanquished, were all cowards and weaklings by then, whose memories, fears, and enthusiasms should not be remembered.</p><p class="calibre3">The first night of retreat was complicated by a fine rain, which required of Ernst and me the agility and balance of acrobats simply to keep our Tatra in the wake of the Mark-4. Without the tank, we would never have been able to escape from that swamp. The driver stepped on the accelerator in fits of irritation, dragging the Tatra, which threatened to disintegrate. The tank treads churned the ground into a heavy syrup, which the rain thinned into soup. The windshield became completely caked with mud, and Ernst waded through the liquid ground to scrape it away with his hands.</p><p class="calibre3">The blacked-out headlight had been left with only a narrow strip uncovered. Within a few minutes this strip was sealed by mud, so that we had no light at all. I couldn't even see the back of the tank, although it was no more than five yards ahead of us. Our truck, more often than not at an oblique angle to the tank, was constantly being pulled back into line by the tightly stretched chain. Each time this happened, I wondered if we still had our front wheels.</p><p class="calibre3">Behind us, the wounded had stopped moaning. Maybe they were all dead-what difference did it make! The convoy moved ahead, and daylight dawned on faces haggard with exhaustion. During the night, the convoy had spread out. It no longer seemed to matter whether we were ahead of schedule or behind. The driver of our Panzer suddenly turned off to the right, leaving the track, which had become impassable even for a tank, and drove straight up the scrub-covered bank, crushing the sodden birches under his treads.</p><p class="calibre3">Our truck, whose wheels by this time were balls of mud, was pulled forward, while its engine rattled helplessly. Then everything came to a complete halt. This was the second stop since our departure. We had stopped once in the night to gas up. The poor bastards on the back of the tank jumped down among the broken branches. Their backsides had been burning all night on the hot metal over the engine, while the rest of their bodies froze in the cold rain. An exchange of shouted abuse which was nearly a fight broke out at once between a noncom in the engineers and the Panzerfuhrer. Everyone else took advantage of this opportunity to crap and eat.</p><p class="calibre3">"One hour's rest!" shouted the noncom, who had taken on himself the leadership of the group. "Make the most of it!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Fuck you," shouted the Panzerfuhrer, who had no intention of being pushed around by some half-baked engineer.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll leave when I've had enough sleep."</p><p class="calibre3">"We have to get to Belgorod this morning," the noncom said in a steely voice. He undoubtedly nourished dreams of being an officer. Then, putting his hand on the Mauser which hung at his side, he added: "We'll leave when I give the order. I've got the highest rank here, and you'll obey me."</p><p class="calibre3">"Shoot me if you like, and drive the tank yourself. I haven't slept in two days, and you're going to leave me the hell alone."</p><p class="calibre3">The other flushed crimson, but said nothing. Then he turned to us. "You two! Instead of standing there asleep on your feet, get into the truck and help the wounded. They have their needs, too."</p><p class="calibre3">"That's it," added the tank driver, who was clearly looking for trouble. "And, when they're finished, the Herr Sergeant will wipe their asses."</p><p class="calibre3">"You watch it, or I'll report you," snorted the sergeant. He was now white with rage.</p><p class="calibre3">Inside the truck, the wounded had not died, despite the jolting of the journey. They were no longer making any noise, and we could see that some of their bandages were soaked with fresh blood. Fighting the exhaustion which made our hearts race, we helped them down and back as best we could-omitting only one man, who was missing both legs. They all asked us for something to drink, and in our ignorance we gave them as much water or brandy as they wanted. We certainly shouldn't have done this: two men died a short time later.</p><p class="calibre3">We buried them in the mud, with sticks and their helmets to mark their graves. Then Ernst and I curled up in the cab, to try to snatch a little sleep. But sleep wouldn't come, and we lay instead, with throbbing temples, talking of peace. Two hours later, it was the tank driver who gave the order to depart, as he had predicted. It was now midmorning. The day was clear and bright, and large chunks of snow fell slowly from the trees.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hah!" he said. "Our general left us all while we were asleep. Maybe he felt like taking a walk!"</p><p class="calibre3">It seemed that the noncom really was gone. He must have managed a ride in one of the trucks that had passed us during our rest.</p><p class="calibre3">"That shit has gone to make his report!" shouted the tank driver. "If I catch up with him, I'll drive right over him, flatten him out like a goddamned Bolshevik!"</p><p class="calibre3">It took us a while to extricate ourselves from the bank we had driven into. However, two hours later we arrived at a hamlet whose name I no longer remember, some five miles from Belgorod. It was filled with soldiers from every branch of the army. The few streets were perfectly straight, and lined with low houses; the way the roofs sat on the walls reminded me of heads with no foreheads, whose hair grows right into the eyebrows. There were swarms of soldiers, and a multitude of rolling equipment covered with mud, pushing through the shouting mob of soldiers, most of whom were looking for their regiments. The road at this point had been roughly resurfaced, and was much more negotiable.</p><p class="calibre3">We unhooked ourselves from the tank, and took on eight or ten of the engineers who had been riding on its back. Somewhat bewildered by this flood of soldiers, I had stopped the truck, and was looking for my company. Two M.Ps told me they thought it had gone on toward Kharkov, but as they weren't sure, they sent me to the redirection center which had been organized in a trailer and was staffed by three officers, who were tearing their hair. When I was finally able to catch their attention through the thousands of shouts and gesticulations besieging them, I was harshly reprimanded for straggling. They probably would have sent me to be court-martialed, if they'd had time. The disorder was incredible, and the landser, half furious, half joking, flooded into the Russian huts.</p><p class="calibre3">We might as well sleep while we wait for all this to settle down."</p><p class="calibre3">All they wanted was a dry corner where they could lie down, but there were so many men crammed into each isba that there was almost no room left for the Russians who lived in them.</p><p class="calibre3">Not knowing what to do with myself, I went to find Ernst, who had gone to look for information. However, he had run into a truck hospital, and had returned to the Tatra with an orderly, who was checking over our wounded.</p><p class="calibre3">"They can go on as they are," he said.</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" Ernst asked. "But we've already buried two of them. At least we should give them fresh dressings."</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be stubborn and stupid. If I label them `urgent,' they'll have to wait their turn, lying in the street. You'll get to Belgorod quicker than that-and escape the trap that's closing on us."</p><p class="calibre3">"Is the situation serious?" Ernst asked.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes."</p><p class="calibre3">So Ernst and I found ourselves responsible for twenty wounded men, some of them in critical condition, who had already been waiting several days for essential medical attention. We didn't know what to say when a man grimacing with pain asked us if he would soon be at the hospital.</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's get going," Ernst said, frowning anxiously. "Maybe he's right. If I'd ever thought it would be like this . . ."</p><p class="calibre3">I had been at the wheel for only a few minutes when Ernst tapped me on the shoulder. "Come on, little one, stop. You'll finish somebody off if it goes on like this. Hand over."</p><p class="calibre3">"But I'm supposed to drive, Ernst. I'm the one who's in the drivers' corps."</p><p class="calibre3">"Never mind. Let me do it. You'll never get us out of here."</p><p class="calibre3">It was true. Despite my best efforts, the truck was jolting and sliding from one side of the road to the other.</p><p class="calibre3">We arrived at the village exit point, where there was an interminable line of vehicles waiting for gas. Thousands of soldiers were walking up and down on either side of the road. An M.P. ran over to us.</p><p class="calibre3">"Why aren't you waiting like everybody else?"</p><p class="calibre3">"We've got to leave right away, Herr Gendarm. We're carrying wounded, and that's what the infirmary told us."</p><p class="calibre3">"Wounded? Serious cases?" He spoke in the doubting, disbelieving tone of every policeman in the world.</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course," said Ernst, who certainly wasn't exaggerating.</p><p class="calibre3">The policeman had to peer under the canvas anyway:</p><p class="calibre3">"They don't look so bad to me."</p><p class="calibre3">There was a furious outburst of swearing. From time to time, wounded men availed themselves of their special position to abuse the police.</p><p class="calibre3">"You sonofabitch," groaned one man, who was missing a piece of his shoulder. "It's shits like you who should be sent to the front. Let us through, or I'll strangle you with the one good hand I have left."</p><p class="calibre3">The feverish landser was sitting up in spite of his pain, which made him frighteningly white. He seemed quite capable of putting this threat into action.</p><p class="calibre3">The policeman flushed, and his nerve faltered at the sight of these twenty battered wrecks. The position of a big-city policeman roaring at some pathetic bourgeois for going through a red light is a far cry from that of an M.P. behind the lines dealing with a gang of combat veterans who are holding their guts in with their hands, or have just bayoneted the guts out of somebody else. His display of bad temper turned into a set little smile.</p><p class="calibre3">"Get out of here," he said, with the air of someone who doesn't give a damn. When the wheels of the truck began to turn, he vented the last of his spleen: "Go and die somewhere else!"</p><p class="calibre3">It was hard to get even eight gallons of gas, and when we managed it our tank swallowed them in an instant. But we were glad to take what we could and get out. A feeble attempt had been made at surfacing the road, but there were still long stretches of bare ground which had become deep quagmires, to be avoided at all costs. We proceeded on the highway, or beside it, as circumstances required.</p><p class="calibre3">Far to the right, we could see another convoy struggling forward in a line parallel to ours. The men were dressed for battle, and seemed to be prepared for an encounter with the Soviets. We were stopped by a new set of police, who combed our papers to see if they could find any mistakes. They checked the truck, verified our I.D. cards and our destination ... but when it came to the destination, they had to give us directions. One of them looked through the directory hanging around his neck, and told us, in a voice like a barking dog's, that we had to turn off the road a hundred yards ahead and proceed to Kharkov. We followed these instructions with regret, because the new road rapidly deteriorated into a ribbon of mire.</p><p class="calibre3">At our speed, we would soon have exhausted our supply of gas.</p><p class="calibre3">We kept passing vehicles abandoned in the mud because of mechanical failure, or because they had run out of gas. A short distance along the new road, we were stopped by a group of about fifty landser, on foot, and in a state of unbelievable filth. They took our truck by storm. There were several wounded men among them. Some of them had ripped off their filthy dressings, and were walking with their wounds open to the air.</p><p class="calibre3">"Make room for us, fellows," they said, hanging on as hard as they could.</p><p class="calibre3">"You can see that we haven't got any room," Ernst answered. "Let go."</p><p class="calibre3">But we couldn't get rid of them. They swarmed over the tailgate, trampling on our wounded to try to make them move over. Ernst and I shouted at them, but it didn't do any good: they piled on everywhere.</p><p class="calibre3">"Take me," whimpered a poor devil scratching at my door with bloody hands. Another waved a pass which was already almost expired. The arrival of a steiner followed by two trucks restored order.</p><p class="calibre3">An S.S. captain climbed out of the steiner.</p><p class="calibre3">"What's this ant heap? No wonder you've broken down! It's impossible! There must be at least a hundred men here."</p><p class="calibre3">The men scattered immediately, without asking for anything more. Ernst saluted, and explained the situation.</p><p class="calibre3">"Very good," said the captain. "You take five more along with your wounded. We'll take another five, and the rest will have to walk until the convoy comes by. Let's get going."</p><p class="calibre3">Ernst explained that we would be out of gas in a few minutes. The captain signaled to some soldiers on the steiner, who gave us six gallons. A few minutes later we were on our way again.</p><p class="calibre3">We kept passing groups of men wading through the mud who begged us to pick them up, but we didn't stop. Toward noon, with our last drop of gas, we reached a town where a unit was being assembled for the front. I escaped becoming an infantryman before my time by a hair's breadth.</p><p class="calibre3">We had to wait until the following day before we could use the reserve of five gallons of gas which Ernst was able to draw. We were about to leave, when an unexpected and unpleasant sound struck our ears. In the distance-still quite far away-we heard the booming of big guns. As we thought we were by now far from the front, we were both astonished and alarmed. We didn't know-and I didn't know until much later-that our course had been taking us parallel to the Belgorod-Kharkov line.</p><p class="calibre3">Nonetheless, after unloading two dying men to make room for three more wounded, we set off without delay. In the middle of that afternoon, everything went wrong again.</p><p class="calibre3">Our truck was more or less in the middle of a column of ten. We had just passed an armored unit whose tanks looked like a giant version of the slimy creatures that emerge on mud flats at low tide. They must have been on their way to meet the enemy, who seemed to be very close. We could hear artillery on our left, despite the loud laboring noises of the trucks. Ernst and l exchanged anxious looks. We were stopped by some soldiers who were setting up an anti-tank gun.</p><p class="calibre3">"Dig in, fellows," shouted an officer as we slowed down. "Ivan's getting pretty close."</p><p class="calibre3">This time, at least, they were telling us something. But I wondered how the Russians, who had been left some ninety miles behind, could already be in this district. Ernst, who was driving, stepped on the gas. Two other trucks did the same. Suddenly, five planes appeared in the sky, at a moderate altitude. I pointed them out to Ernst.</p><p class="calibre3">"They're Yaks," he shouted. "Take cover!"</p><p class="calibre3">We were surrounded by bare mud, with occasional clumps of stunted brush. There was a sound of machine-gun fire from the sky. The column drove more quickly, toward a shallow fold in the ground which might give some protection. I was leaning out the window, trying to see through the flying mud spun by our wheels. Two Focke Wolfs had appeared, and had shot down two of the Yaks, which crashed far to the west.</p><p class="calibre3">Until the final stages of the war, Russian aircraft were no match for the Luftwaffe. Even in Prussia, where Russian airpower was its most active, the appearance of one Messerschmitt-109, or one Focke-Wolf would make a dozen armored Ilyushin bombers turn and run. At this period, when German airpower still possessed important reserves, the lot of the Russian pilots was not enviable.</p><p class="calibre3">Two of the three remaining Yaks had taken flight, pursued by our planes, when the last dived straight at the convoy. One of the Focke Wulfs was chasing him, and was plainly trying to get him in his sights.</p><p class="calibre3">We reached the dip in the road. The Soviet plane had come down very low, to use its machine guns. The trucks ahead of us had stopped short, and the able-bodied were jumping down into the mud. I was already holding the door open, and I jumped, with my feet together, plunging face downward, when I heard the machine guns.</p><p class="calibre3">With my nose in the mud, my hands on my head, and my eyes instinctively shut, I heard the machine gun and the two planes through a hellish intensity of noise. The sound of racing engines was followed by a loud explosion. I looked up, to watch the plane with the black crosses on its wings regain altitude. Three or four hundred yards away, where the Yak had crashed, there was a plume of black smoke. Everybody was getting up again.</p><p class="calibre3">"One more who won't give any trouble," shouted a fat corporal who was clearly delighted to be still alive.</p><p class="calibre3">Several voices joined in a cheer for the Luftwaffe.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anybody hit?" one of the noncoms called out. "Let's get going, then."</p><p class="calibre3">I walked over to the Tatra, trying to brush off the worst of the mud that clung to my uniform. I noticed two holes in the door I had opened to get out which appeared to have swung shut on its own momentum: two round holes, each outlined by a ring of metal from which the paint had been scraped away. Nervously, I pulled open the door. Inside, I saw a man I shall never forget-a man sitting normally on the seat, whose lower face had been reduced to a bloody pulp.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ernst?" I asked in a choking voice. "Ernst!" I threw myself at him. "Ernst! What . . . ? Say something! Ernst!" I looked frantically for some features on that horrible face. "Ernst!" I was nearly crying.</p><p class="calibre3">Outside, the column was getting ready to leave. The two trucks behind me were impatiently blowing their horns.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey." I ran toward the first of the trucks. "Stop. Come with me. I've got a wounded man."</p><p class="calibre3">I was frantic. The doors of the truck behind me swung open and two soldiers stuck out their heads.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, young fellow, are you going to move, or aren't you?" "Stop!" I shouted louder than ever. "I've got a wounded man." "We have thirty," one of the soldiers shouted back. "Get going. The hospital isn't too far from here."</p><p class="calibre3">Their voices rose over mine, and the noise of their trucks, which had pulled out, and were passing me, drowned my cries of desperation. Now I was alone, with a Russian truck loaded with wounded men, and Ernst Neubach, who was dead, or dying.</p><p class="calibre3">"You shits! Wait for me! Don't go without us!"</p><p class="calibre3">I burst into tears, and gave way to a mad impulse. I grabbed my Mauser, which I'd left in the truck. My eyes were swimming, and I could barely see. I felt for the trigger, and pointing the gun at the sky, fired all five cartridges in the magazine, hoping that to someone in the trucks this would sound like a cry for help. But no one stopped. The trucks continued to roll away from me, sending out a spray of mud on each side. In despair, I returned to the cabin, and ripped open my kit to look for a package of dressings.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ernst," I said. "I'm going to bandage you. Don't cry."</p><p class="calibre3">I was insane. Ernst wasn't crying: I was. His coat was covered with blood. With the dressings in my hand, I stared at my friend. He</p><p class="calibre3">must have been hit in the lower jaw. His teeth were mixed with fragments of bone, and through the gore I could see the muscles of his face contracting, moving what was left of his features.</p><p class="calibre3">In a state of near shock, I tried to put the dressing somewhere on that cavernous wound. When this proved impossible, I pushed a needle into the tube of morphine, and jabbed ineffectually through the thick nesses of cloth. Crying like a small boy, I pushed my friend to the other end of the seat, holding him in my arms, and soaking in his blood. Two eyes opened, brilliant with anguish, and looked at me from his ruined face.</p><p class="calibre3">Ernst!" I laughed through my tears. "Ernst!"</p><p class="calibre3">He slowly lifted his hand and put it on my forearm. Half choked with emotion, I started the truck, and managed to begin moving without too great a jolt.</p><p class="calibre3">For a quarter of an hour, I drove through a web of ruts with one eye on my friend. His grip on my arm tightened and eased in proportion to his pain, and his death rattle rose and fell, sometimes louder than the noise of the truck.</p><p class="calibre3">Choking back my tears, I prayed, without reason or thought, saying anything that came into my head.</p><p class="calibre3">"Save him. Save Ernst, God. He believed in you. Save him. Show yourself."</p><p class="calibre3">But God did not answer my appeals. In the cab of a gray Russian truck, somewhere in the vastness of the Russian hinterland, a man and an adolescent were caught in a desperate struggle. The man struggled with death, and the adolescent struggled with despair, which is close to death. And God, who watches everything, did nothing. The breath of the dying man passed with difficulty through that horrible wound, making huge bubbles of blood and saliva. I considered every possibility. I could turn back and look for help, or force the men I was carrying to tend Ernst, at gunpoint if necessary, or even kill Ernst, to cut short his sufferings. But I knew very well I couldn't kill him. I had not yet been obliged to fire directly at anyone.</p><p class="calibre3">My tears had dried, leaving the trace of their passage on my filthy face, to betray my weakness to the world. I was no longer crying, and my feverish eyes stared at the knob on the radiator two meters in front of me, which cut hypnotically into the interminable horizon. For long moments, Ernst's hand would tighten on my arm, and each time I was overwhelmed by fresh panic. I couldn't look at that horrifying face. Several German planes passed overhead, through the cloudy sky, and in a desperate attempt at telepathy every fiber in my body appealed to them for help. But maybe they were Russian planes. It didn't matter;</p><p class="calibre3">I had no time to spare. No time to spare: the expression assumed its full significance, as so many expressions do in wartime.</p><p class="calibre3">Ernst's hand gripped my arm convulsively. The pressure continued for so long that I slid my foot off the accelerator, and stopped, afraid of the worst. I turned and looked at the mutilated face, whose eyes seemed to be fixed on something the living can't see. Those eyes were veiled by a curious film. My heart was pumping so hard that I felt actual physical pain. I refused to believe what I could guess without difficulty.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ernst!" I shouted.</p><p class="calibre3">From the back of the truck my shout was answered by several others.</p><p class="calibre3">I pushed my companion down on the seat, imploring heaven to let him live. But his body fell heavily against the other side of the cabin. Death! He was dead! Ernst! Mama! Help me!</p><p class="calibre3">In a delirium of terror, I leaned against the truck door, and then let myself drop, trembling, onto the running board. I tried to persuade myself that none of this was happening, that it was all a nightmare from which I would wake to see another horizon.</p><p class="calibre3">As I sat and thought, I still had no idea of the extent of irremediable evil. I dreamed of what life would be like when I shook off this horrible nightmare in which my friend had just died. But my eyes could see only mud, sucking at my boots.</p><p class="calibre3">Two heads looked out from the back of the truck. They were saying something but I didn't hear them. I stood up, and turning my back on them, walked off a short distance. That small physical effort reawakened some sense of life and hope, and I tried to tell myself that all of this wasn't really serious, that it was only a bad dream I had to forget. I tried to impose an expression of smiling derision on my features. Two of the wounded men jumped down from the truck to relieve themselves. I stared at them unseeing, while the vitality of being alive beat back the darkness. I began to think with hope that surely all the German soldiers in Russia would be sent to help us, that something must be coming to help us. Suddenly I thought of the French. They were already on their way: all our newspapers said so. The first legionnaires had already set out. I had seen the photographs.</p><p class="calibre3">I felt a hot flush run through me. Ernst would be avenged: that poor fool who had never hurt a fly, who had spent his time making life more endurable for wretched soldiers shaking with cold. And his marvelous hot showers! The French would come, and I would run to embrace them. Ernst had loved them like his own compatriots. This surge of hope and joy could not be damped by facts I didn't know-like the fact that the French had decided on quite another course.</p><p class="calibre3">"What's happened?" asked one of the men, whose gray bandage was falling over his eyes. "Are we out of gas?"</p><p class="calibre3">"No. My friend has just been killed." They looked into the cabin.</p><p class="calibre3">"Fuck . . . that's not so bad. At least he didn't have to suffer." I knew that Ernst's agony had lasted for nearly half an hour. "We ought to bury him," one of them said.</p><p class="calibre3">The three of us lifted out the body, which was already stiffening. I moved like an automaton, and my face was without expression. I saw a small rise of ground which was less trampled than everywhere else, and we took Ernst there.</p><p class="calibre3">We had no shovels, so we dug the grave with our helmets, rifle butts, and bare hands. I myself collected Ernst's identity tags and papers. The other two were already pushing back the dirt, and trampling it down with their boots when I looked my last on that mutilated face. I felt that something had hardened in my spirit forever. Nothing could be worse than this. We pushed in a stick at the head of the grave, and hung Ernst's helmet on it. I slit the stick with the point of my bayonet, and slid in a piece of paper torn from the notebook Ernst always carried with him, inscribed naively in French: "Ici j'ai enterre mon ami, Ernst Neubach."</p><p class="calibre3">Then, to forestall another emotional crisis, I turned and ran back to the truck.</p><p class="calibre3">We started off again. One of the wounded had come to the front and taken Ernst's place: a stupid-looking man, who fell asleep almost at once. Ten minutes later, the motor coughed, and then died. The jolt woke my sleeping companion.</p><p class="calibre3">"Something wrong with the engine?"</p><p class="calibre3">"No," I said in an offhand voice. "We're out of gas." "Shit. So what'll we do?"</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll walk. On this nice sunny day it should be grand. The strongest will have to help the others."</p><p class="calibre3">My friend's death had abruptly turned me into a cynic, and I felt almost glad that the others would have to suffer with me. My companion looked me up and down.</p><p class="calibre3">"You don't mean that. We can't walk. We're all burning up with fever."</p><p class="calibre3">His stupid assurance made me furious. He was clearly a half-wit who never questioned anything, and had gone to war because he'd been sent. Then a Russian shell had gone off too close, and he'd been pierced, and that is all he felt or knew. Since then, he'd been dozing and stuffing himself with sulfanilamide.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, you can stay here, and wait for help, or for Ivan. I'm clearing out." </p><p class="calibre3">I ran to the back door, kicked it open, and explained the situation. Inside, it stank. The men were lying in a revolting mess. Some of them didn't even hear me, and I felt ashamed and brutal. But what else was there to do? Seven or eight haggard men pulled themselves up. Their faces were amazingly drawn. Shaggy beards sprouted from their lined cheeks, and their eyes burned with fever. I felt sickened, and unwilling to insist that they walk. When they had climbed down, they discussed the fate of the others.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's impossible to get them up. Let's just leave without telling them. Maybe someone will be along to help them. They're still coming behind us."</p><p class="calibre3">Our wretched group set off, haunted by the dying men we had abandoned in the Tatra. But what else could we have done?</p><p class="calibre3">I was the only man without an injury, and the only man with a gun. I had offered Neubach's gun, but no one wanted to carry it. A short time later, a muddy sidecar caught up with us, and stopped, although we hadn't flagged them. It carried two soldiers who belonged to an armored unit: two generous men. One of them decided to give his place to a wounded man, and, collecting his belongings, got out and walked with us. Somehow, the sidecar managed to take on three wounded.</p><p class="calibre3">And so once more I had a strong young man to keep me company, whose humane gesture, if nothing else, made him a sympathetic human being. I no longer remember his name, but I do remember that we talked long and deeply about many things. He told me that the Russian offensive had been mounted very suddenly, and that throughout this vast region we might be stopped at any moment by a Russian motorized unit. My throat went dry, but my companion seemed sure of himself, and of our army.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll resume the offensive now that it's spring. We'll throw the Popovs back across the Don, and then the Volga."</p><p class="calibre3">It's astonishing how agreeable it is to meet confidence and enthusiasm when one is feeling lost. It was as if heaven had sent me this healthy animal to revive my morale. I would have liked things more if Neubach had still been alive, but one must remain humble and resigned in the face of Providence. After all, it was I who should have been driving instead of Neubach.</p><p class="calibre3">Toward evening, we came to an isolated country farmhouse. We approached cautiously. The partisans often used places like this: they had the same choices we did, and for anyone a roof is a roof.</p><p class="calibre3">The tall young man who had joined us walked out ahead, slowly and deliberately, with his hand on his gun. For a moment he disappeared behind the farmyard buildings, and we felt a twinge of anxiety. But he reappeared and waved us on. The farm was inhabited by a group of Russians who did everything they could to make the wounded men comfortable. The women cooked us a hot meal. They told us that they hated Communism. They had been deported from a small farm they had owned in the neighborhood of Vitebsk to work on the big kolkhoz we were now walking through. They said they had often given shelter to German soldiers. They had an amphibious V.W. in one of their sheds, which had broken down and been abandoned by one of our sections. They said that the partisans never bothered them because they knew that the Wehrmacht often used their buildings. Our tall newcomer felt somewhat uneasy about the V.W.; the Russians might be lying. They could have stolen it. We tried to start it, but although the engine turned over, the vehicle wouldn't move.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll fix it tomorrow," the big man said. "We ought to rest now. I'll take the first watch, and you can relieve me at midnight."</p><p class="calibre3">"We're going to stand watch?" I asked in surprise.</p><p class="calibre3">"We have to. You can't trust these people. All Russians are liars." This meant another night of anxiety. I walked to the back of the shed, which was dark. There was a jumble of sacks, sheaves of dried sunflower stalks, ropes, and boards, which I arranged as a rough bed. I was about to take off my boots when my companion stopped me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't do that. You'll never be able to stand them tomorrow. You have to let them dry on your feet."</p><p class="calibre3">I was on the point of replying that the sodden leather would prevent my feet from drying ... but I didn't. What difference did it make if my feet were wet or my boots were wet? I myself was soaked through and filthy and so tired....</p><p class="calibre3">"You should wash your feet though. That will make you feel fresher, and better tomorrow, too."</p><p class="calibre3">What sort of a fellow was this? He was as dirty as I, but he seemed to be full of will and ardor and spirit, as if nothing fundamental to his being had been damaged.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm too tired," I said. He laughed.</p><p class="calibre3">I threw myself down on my back, overcome by the exhaustion which ached in the muscles of my shoulders and neck. I stared into the shadows, caught by an indefinable fear. Above me, the dusty beams were lost in the darkness. My sleep was leaden and dreamless. Only happy people have nightmares, from overeating. For those who live a nightmare reality, sleep is a black hole, lost in time, like death.</p><p class="calibre3">A movement of air shook my heavy head. I sat up slowly. It was already broad daylight, and the sky was shining through the wide door of the shed. Beside the door, next to a large chest, my companion of yesterday sat slumped in sleep. I jumped up like a shot. The idea crossed my mind that he might already be dead. I had learned that life and death can be so close that one can pass from one to the other without attracting any attention. The fresh morning air was shaken by the sound of explosions.</p><p class="calibre3">I went over to the other soldier and shook him vigorously. He groaned like a drunk who is being questioned. "Wake up!"</p><p class="calibre3">This time he stood up in a single movement. His sleep had exploded like a bomb. Instinctively he reached for his gun. I felt almost afraid.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes? ... What is it?" he asked. "Teufel, it's daylight. I fell asleep on guard, Goddamnit!"</p><p class="calibre3">He looked so furious that I kept myself from laughing. His inadequate vigilance had given us both a good night's sleep. Suddenly he pointed his gun at the open door. Before I could turn around, I heard a foreign voice, and one of the Russians who had received us the day before came and stood in the doorway.</p><p class="calibre3">"Kamerad," he repeated in German. "This morning no good. Boom boom pretty close."</p><p class="calibre3">We went out of the shed. On the roof of the little building in front of us, some Russians from the kolkhoz were inspecting the horizon. We heard some more long-drawn-out explosions.</p><p class="calibre3">"Bolsheviks very close," said one of the Ukrainians, turning to us. "We'll leave with kamerad soldat German."</p><p class="calibre3">"Where are the wounded?" my companion asked, irritated at having been caught off balance.</p><p class="calibre3">"Where you put yesterday," answered the Popov. "Two kamerad German dead."</p><p class="calibre3">We looked at him in confusion.</p><p class="calibre3">"Come and help us," my companion said.</p><p class="calibre3">Two of the more seriously wounded men had died. There were now four, all in poor condition. One of them was groaning and holding his right arm, whose hand was missing. His purulent dressing glistened with the gangrene which was already devouring him.</p><p class="calibre3">"Dig two graves over there," ordered the tall soldier. "We must bury these men."</p><p class="calibre3">"We not soldiers," answered the Popov, still smiling.</p><p class="calibre3">"You ... dig grave ... two graves," insisted the. German, aiming his gun at the Russians. "Two graves, and quick!"</p><p class="calibre3">The Russian's eye gleamed wildly as he stared at the black hollow of the gun barrel. He said a few words in Russian, and the others busied themselves with the job.</p><p class="calibre3">We had begun to change the dressings of the wounded when we heard the sound of a motor in the courtyard. Without thinking, we ran out. Several armored vehicles had just driven in, and a gang of German soldiers were running toward the big drinking trough. They were followed by four or five Mark-4s. An officer climbed from a steiner, and we ran to meet him, telling him who we were.</p><p class="calibre3">"Alles gut," said the officer. "Help us load up, and leave with us." We tried to get the amphibious V.W. to start, but that proved impossible. We dragged it from the hut, and one of the landser threw a grenade into the engine. A moment later, it blew to pieces. More vehicles arrived. Others left in the direction from which we'd come. We couldn't understand what was happening. The sound of explosions from the southeast was continuous. The road that ran through the kolkhoz was a stream of traffic of every description. Whenever anyone stopped I asked for news of my unit, but no one knew anything. It seemed likely that my companions of the 19th Rollbahn were far to the west by now-far from the front, to which it seemed I was being sent. A little while later, I turned west again, in a company of soldiers drawn from many infantry units. The fact that I was involved with this group caused me considerable difficulty a few days later. We appeared to be taking a line parallel to the front, at right angles to the Russian thrust. Far to the north, the Russians were pushing toward the south, hoping to surround the German forces still in the Voronezh-Kursk-Kharkov triangle. For a day and a half, we followed a muddy rut, on which our only troubles were mechanical. The machines we were using had been in Russia since the German advance of 1941, and had been pushed hard. Our forces were obliged to abandon large numbers of trucks and tractors and tanks.</p><p class="calibre3">The tanks in particular had taken a beating, often having been used for work their designers had never imagined. They were almost the only vehicles able to move normally during the winter months, and a tank pulling five trucks along a snowy mule track was not an unusual sight. When they had to face the Russian counter-offensive, this rough usage, coupled with their lightness, which had served us so well until then, made them no match for the famous T-34s, incontestably superior to the Mark-2s and -3s. Later, our Tigers and Panthers stood up to Soviet armor, and played with their T-34s and KW-85s.</p><p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, as in the air, our inadequate numbers had to yield to an enemy multitude fighting on two fronts. We were obliged, in effect, to defend a fortress with a circumference of two thousand miles.</p><p class="calibre3">To cite a single example: the fighting on the Vistula, north of Krakow, pitted twenty-eight thousand Germans supported by thirty-six Tiger tanks and twenty Panthers against two strong Soviet armies of six hundred thousand men and seven armored regiments disposing of eleven hundred tanks of various kinds.</p><p class="calibre3">Toward noon the next day, we arrived at a small village about fifteen miles northeast of Kharkov, with a name like Outcheni. I can no longer remember precisely. The place was filled with smoke, and to judge by the noise fighting was still going on quite nearby.</p><p class="calibre3">The steiner of the officer who bad picked us up at the kolkhoz drew ahead, while the rest of us jumped down from our machines. Flickering light a mile or so to the south marked the line of fire. The soldiers who had come with me peed into a hedge or chewed some food, with blank faces. I myself have never been able to achieve a resigned, indifferent attitude in the face of pressing danger; nevertheless, I tried to hide my desperate anxiety. Perhaps the others were doing the same thing. The steiner came back, and two noncoms wrote down our names. Then we were organized into groups of fifteen, led either by a sergeant or an obergefreiter.*( * Senior lance corporal, or acting corporal.)</p><p class="calibre3"> The officer climbed onto the seat of the steiner and spoke to us briefly, mincing no words.</p><p class="calibre3">"The enemy has cut us off from our line of retreat. To get around them, we would have to turn north, onto the plain, where there are no roads. This could be fatal. Therefore, we will have to break through their barrage to reach our new positions, which are quite close.</p><p class="calibre3">"As further elements of the Don army arrive, they will be used to maintain the passage already opened, which will allow all our soldiers to escape the Bolshevik noose. Thereafter, you will proceed to positions which will be announced, and which you will maintain until further orders. Good luck! Heil Hitler!"</p><p class="calibre3">I was about to say that I belonged to the transport service, when I suddenly felt ashamed. Munitions boxes were opened, and their contents distributed. My pockets and cartridge pouches were full, and I was given two defensive grenades, which I didn't know how to operate. We moved single file to the edge of the village past houses burning from enemy incendiaries. Groups of men were walking about in the debris; others were tending to the wounded. Some burnt-out German vehicles were still smoking. We were taken over by a lieutenant, who asked five or six of us to follow him down a long street which was still more or less intact. A salvo whistled past us, and we threw ourselves to the ground. It fell somewhere in the center of the village, about seven or eight hundred yards behind us. Enemy shells had dug several holes in the packed earth which lay between two rows of buildings, and occasional mutilated bodies lay sprawled on the street.</p><p class="calibre3">We walked for about fifteen minutes, sticking close to the buildings, until we heard the sound of automatic weapons. About a hundred yards ahead of us, the street was swept by mortar fire. We hesitated for a moment. Then we saw some running figures emerging from the wall of dust stirred up by the enemy salvo.</p><p class="calibre3">"Achtung!" shouted the lieutenant.</p><p class="calibre3">Instantly, we dropped to our knees, or even onto our stomachs, ready to open fire, but stood up again when we saw German uniforms. The other soldiers ran over to us, and threw themselves down by our sides. We could see that still more were coming through the flying dust. Several of them were howling at the tops of their lungs, a sound which combined fear, anger, and pain.</p><p class="calibre3">I watched a soldier without a gun, who was trying to run holding his right thigh with both hands. He fell, stood up, and fell again. Two others were staggering slowly after him. I heard someone shout, "A moi!" and was trying to see which of them had used my language, when a fresh salvo struck the group, scattering about ten of them in search of shelter.</p><p class="calibre3">Two of the men continued toward us, despite the danger. They ran to a door, which they were able to kick in without much trouble, and stood in its opening, shouting curses in French.</p><p class="calibre3">Amazed, and without a thought of danger, I ran across the street, bursting in on them like a whirlwind. They paid no attention to me. "Hey," I said, shaking one of them by his straps. "Are you French?"</p><p class="calibre3">They turned toward me and looked at me for a fraction of a second. Then their eyes returned to a cloud of dust and smoke pouring from a house which had just burst into flames.</p><p class="calibre3">"No. The Walloon Division," one of them said, without looking back a second time.</p><p class="calibre3">A series of explosions made us blink and hunch our shoulders. "Those shits shoot us just like rabbits. They never take prisoners, the bastards."</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm French," I said, with an uncertain smile.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well then, look out. Volunteers are never prisoners." "But I'm not a volunteer!"</p><p class="calibre3">The street was raked by a new salvo of mortar fire, somewhat closer than before. Twenty yards away, a roof disintegrated, and the retreat whistle broke off our conversation. We ran as hard as we could back the way we had just come, followed by a burst of machine-gun fire. Two or three men spun round and doubled up, screaming with pain. We almost ran over two men with a heavy machine gun, which they hadn't been able to fire, because we'd been in the way.</p><p class="calibre3">Several groups of men had reached a street at right angles to ours, and had scattered among the ruins. The lieutenant was blowing his whistle again, to regroup us, when two Mark-3s suddenly came into sight. They rolled up to the lieutenant, who stood in the middle of the street waving them forward. After a brief consultation, they moved obliquely into the street we had just left, advancing toward the Bolsheviks. The lieutenant tried to reorganize us again, and we set off in the wake of the tanks, which made an infernal din in the rubble-filled streets. I jumped from the corners of buildings to piles of rubble, in a state of terror, unable to grasp why I was there, or to distinguish anything to fire at.</p><p class="calibre3">For seconds at a time, our tanks would disappear from view in the turmoil of dust and smoke and flames, but they always re-emerged, with their guns firing. Soon we had run past the point where our retreat had begun, and into an open space surrounded by wooden peasant houses grouped around a pond. The tanks were driving around the pond, crushing every obstacle. On the far side of the pond we could easily see men running in several directions. We stood on the bank, and opened a concentrated fire. Another German company arrived on our right, and threw grenades at a house in which some of the enemy had taken shelter.</p><p class="calibre3">Our tanks were now on the other side of the pond, and were flattening the position just taken from the enemy. At last I had the opportunity to fire at some Russians. They were no more than thirty yards away,: running from the house our soldiers had attacked with grenades. At least ten Mausers fired, and not one of the Russians stood up again. The fact that we were advancing, and that we felt ourselves suddenly in control of the situation, stimulated us in spite of everything. We had just dislodged an enemy numerically stronger than we-as was always the case in Russia-and we felt as if we'd been given wings.</p><p class="calibre3">The sound of firing and the groans of the wounded incited us to massacre the Russians, who had inflicted us with so many horrifying wounds. An attacking army is always more enthusiastic than an army on the defensive, and more likely to accomplish prodigies. This was particularly true of the German Army, which was organized to attack, and whose defense consisted of slowing the enemy by counter-attack. A few of our men took over a Russian cannon, and immediately put it into action. A rapid liaison was established between our two tanks and this newly improvised artillery, which poured all the shells just captured from the Russians onto precisely selected targets.</p><p class="calibre3">Then the tanks turned back, leaving the defense of the area to us.</p><p class="calibre3">Directed by the lieutenant, we placed ourselves as best we could, in readiness for any new surprises. We could hear the sound of continuous firing all around us. A fine rain began to fall.</p><p class="calibre3">At dusk, we were still exchanging fire with the enemy, who had grown bolder, and were trying to come back. With darkness, our terror returned, and the firing almost stopped. The lieutenant sent someone to fetch some flares. To the southwest, the horizon lit up in time with sporadic heavy artillery fire. Without knowing it, we had become part of the third battle of Kharkov, whose front extended for some two hundred miles around the city. With darkness and rain, the fighting, for our group, was almost over. Behind us, we could still hear the sound of automatics, which penetrated the noise of engines. Our vehicles were using the darkness to try to get through the Russian barrage. We thought that at any moment we might see the Popovs running toward us through the night. A Volkswagen came up from behind with all its lights out. The driver spoke for a moment with the leader of our group, and then handed some flat mines to four of our men.</p><p class="calibre3">With white faces, they went off into the darkness, to place the mines on either side of the pond. Five minutes later, we heard a rough cry from the left, and a short time after that, two of the four came back from the right. After another half hour, we concluded that the two who had gone to the left had run into a Russian knife.</p><p class="calibre3">Much later that night, when we were all feeling overwhelmed by sleep, we witnessed a tragedy that froze my blood. We had just thrown about a dozen grenades at random, to forestall some suspected danger, when a prolonged and penetrating cry rose from the hole on my left. It lasted for several minutes, as if it were coming from the throat of someone who was fighting desperately. Then there was a cry for help, which brought us all from our holes and shelters. About ten of us ran toward the sound. The darkness was torn by the white lights of several shots. Fortunately, no one was hit.</p><p class="calibre3">We arrived at the edge of a foxhole, where a Russian, who had just thrown down his revolver, was holding his hands in the air. At the bottom of the hole, two men were fighting. One of them, a Russian, was waving a large cutlass, holding a man from our group pinned beneath him. Two of us covered the Russian who had raised his hands, while a young obergefreiter jumped into the hole and struck the other Russian a blow on the back of his neck with a trenching tool. The Russian let go at once, and the German who had been under him, who had just missed having his throat cut, ran up to ground level. He was covered with blood, brandishing the Russian knife with one hand, like a madman, while with the other he tried to stop the flow of blood pouring from his wound.</p><p class="calibre3">"Where is he?" he shouted in a fury.</p><p class="calibre3">"Where's the other one?"</p><p class="calibre3">In a few bounding steps he reached the two men and their prisoner. Before anyone could do anything, he had run his knife into the belly of the petrified Russian.</p><p class="calibre3">"Cutthroat," he yelled, looking with wild eyes for another belly to open.</p><p class="calibre3">We had to hold him so he wouldn't run past our lines.</p><p class="calibre3">"Let me go!" he shrieked.</p><p class="calibre3">"I want to show these savages how to use a knife."</p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up!" shouted the lieutenant, exasperated by having to deal with such a motley crew.</p><p class="calibre3">"Get back into your foxholes before Ivan machine guns the lot of you."</p><p class="calibre3">The lunatic, who was losing a lot of blood, was dragged to the rear by two men. I went back to the hole I was sharing with four others. I would gladly have fallen asleep, but nervous exhaustion kept me awake.</p><p class="calibre3">I had not yet absorbed all the emotions of the day, and was suffering a belated reaction.</p><p class="calibre3">The intermittent rain began to soak into our clothes and weight them down. The pond gave off a faint smell. Two men began to snore. Throughout the night, which seemed interminable, I kept up a dull conversation with my companions, to prevent a nervous collapse. In the distance, we could hear the continuous rumble of our retreating trucks. Enemy action began again well before dawn. Flares above our position blinded us with their unexpected white lights. We looked at each other in wordless confusion. The intensity of this diabolic light threw a sinister, almost indecent glare on our ghostly faces.</p><p class="calibre3">At daybreak, enemy artillery poured a hail of projectiles of every caliber onto the road about a quarter of a mile behind us. Beyond my hole, when I dared look outside, I could see other helmets poking up here and there from below the ground. Under their visors, eyes gleaming with fatigue were trying to discern our immediate future on the dim bank across the pond.</p><p class="calibre3">I scraped up some crumbs of vitamin biscuit, which was the last food in my possession. Insomnia and exhaustion made us incapable of grasping the situation with any precision. We were simply there, shivering and wet, and if even a small group of Russians had appeared, we wouldn't have been able to stop them.</p></body>
